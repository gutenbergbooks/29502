<p>The love of adventure, the expectation of the
unexpected, have ever prompted men stout of
heart, and ready of resource, to brave the perils
of wilderness and sea that they might set their
feet where man never trod before. The world
owes much to the explorers who have faced hostile
savages, stood in jeopardy from the cobra
and the lion, the foes as deadly which lurk in the
brook which quenches thirst. A traveller like
Clarke takes his life in his hands. He breaks
a path which leads he knows not whither: it may
bring him to a shore whence he has no ship
to sail from; it may end in an abyss he cannot
bridge. The thickets rend and sting him, poison
may colour a tempting grain or berry, frost may
deaden his energies and lull him to the sleep that
knows no waking. He has but little aid from
science: beyond food and medicine he carries
little more than a watch, a compass, a rifle,
and a cartridge belt. Beyond all instruments
and weapons are his skill, agility, gumption,
diplomacy. And these resources in no mean
measure are shared by the man for whom he
prepares the way, the immigrant, who, in the
early days of settlement, requires a constancy
even higher than the explorer's own. It is one
thing to traverse a wilderness under the excitement
of hourly adventure; it is another thing to
stay there for a lifetime and convert it to a home.</p>

<p>The race of American explorers is not extinct.
Major Powell is with us to-day, hale and hearty
still. Peary, in the prime of his powers, is as
capital an example of courage and resource as
ever threw themselves upon the riddle of the
frozen north. Beyond the Arctic and Antarctic
circles little remains unknown on earth. When
at last every rood of ground and knot of sea is
mapped and charted, whither shall the explorer
direct his steps? He cannot repeat the conquests
of Lewis and Clarke, Pike and Peary,
but he need not on that account fold his hands
so long as a brave heart and a quick wit are
wanted in the world.</p>

First Voyage&rdquo; from &ldquo;Christopher Columbus and How He
Received and Imparted the Spirit of Discovery,&rdquo; copyright

<p>So, everything being ready, on the 3rd of
August, 1492, a half-hour before sunrise, he unmoored
his little fleet in the stream, and, spreading
his sails, the vessels passed out of the little
river roadstead of Palos, gazed after, perhaps,
in the increasing light, as the little crafts reached
the ocean, by the friar of Rabida, from its distant
promontory of rock.</p>

<p>The day was Friday, and the advocates of
Columbus's canonization have not failed to see
a purpose in its choice as the day of our Redemption,
and as that of the deliverance of the Holy
Sepulchre by Geoffrey de Bouillon, and of the
rendition of Granada, with the fall of the Moslem
power in Spain. We must resort to the books of
such advocates, if we would enliven the picture
with a multitude of rites and devotional feelings
that they gather in the meshes of the story of
the departure. They supply to the embarkation
a variety of detail that their holy purposes readily
imagine, and place Columbus at last on his poop,
with the standard of the Cross, the image of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Saviour nailed to the holy wood, waving in the
early breeze that heralded the day. The embellishments
may be pleasing, but they are not
of the strictest authenticity.</p>

<p>In order that his performance of an embassy
to the princes of the East might be duly chronicled,
Columbus determined, as his journal says,
to keep an account of the voyage by the west,
&ldquo;by which course,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;unto the present
time, we do not know, <i>for certain</i>, that any one
has passed.&rdquo; It was his purpose to write down,
as he proceeded, everything he saw and all that
he did, and to make a chart of his discoveries,
and to show the directions of his track.</p>

<p>Nothing occurred during those early August
days to mar his run to the Canaries, except the
apprehension which he felt that an accident,
happening to the rudder of the <i>Pinta</i>,&mdash;a steering
gear now for some time in use, in place of the
old lateral blades,&mdash;was a trick of two men, her
owners, Gomez Rascon and Christopher Quintero,
to impede a voyage in which they had no heart.
The Admiral knew the disposition of these men
well enough not to be surprised at the mishap,
but he tried to feel secure in the prompt energy
of Pinzon, who commanded the <i>Pinta</i>.</p>

<p>As he passed (August 24-25, 1492) the peak
of Teneriffe, it was the time of an eruption,
of which he makes bare mention in his
journal. It is to the corresponding passage of
the <i>Historie</i>, [written by his son, Fernando,]
that we owe the somewhat sensational stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of the terrors of the sailors, some of whom certainly
must long have been accustomed to like
displays in the volcanoes of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>At the Gran Canarie the <i>Nina</i> was left to have
her lateen sails changed to square ones; and the
<i>Pinta</i>, it being found impossible to find a better
vessel to take her place, was also left to be overhauled
for her leaks, and to have her rudder
again repaired, while Columbus visited Gomera,
another of the islands. The fleet was reunited
at Gomera on September 2. Here he fell in
with some residents of the Ferro, the westermost
of the group, who repeated the old stories of land
occasionally seen from its heights, lying towards
the setting sun. Having taken on board wood,
water, and provisions, Columbus finally sailed
from Gomera on the morning of Thursday,
September 6. He seems to have soon spoken
a vessel from Ferro, and from this he learned
that three Portuguese caravels were lying in
wait for him in the neighbourhood of that island,
with a purpose, as he thought, of visiting in some
way upon him, for having gone over to the
interests of Spain, the indignation of the Portuguese
king. He escaped encountering them.</p>

<p>Up to Sunday, September 9, they had experienced
so much calm weather, that their progress
had been slow. This tediousness soon
raised an apprehension in the mind of Columbus
that the voyage might prove too long for the
constancy of his men. He accordingly determined
to falsify his reckoning. This deceit was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
a large confession of his own timidity in dealing
with his crew, and it marked the beginning of a
long struggle with deceived and mutinous subordinates,
which forms so large a part of the
record of his subsequent career.</p>

<p>The result of Monday's sail, which he knew to
be sixty leagues, he noted as forty-eight, so that
the distance from home might appear less than
it was. He continued to practise this deceit.</p>

<p>The distances given by Columbus are those of
dead reckoning beyond any question. Lieutenant
Murdock, of the United States Navy, who
has commented on this voyage, makes his league
the equivalent of three modern nautical miles,
and his mile about three-quarters of our present
estimate for that distance. Navarrete says that
Columbus reckoned in Italian miles, which are a
quarter less than Spanish miles. The Admiral
had expected to make land after sailing about
seven hundred leagues from Ferro; and in ordering
his vessels in case of separation to proceed
westward, he warned them when they sailed
that distance to come to the wind at night, and
only to proceed by day.</p>

<p>The log as at present understood in navigation
had not yet been devised. Columbus depended
in judging of his distance on the eye alone, basing
his calculations on the passage of objects or
bubbles past the ship, while the running out of
his hour glasses afforded the multiple for long
distances.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the 13th of September, he notes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
that the ships were encountering adverse currents.
He was now three degrees west of Flores, and the
needle of the compass pointed as it had never
been observed before, directly to the true north.
His observation of this fact marks a significant
point in the history of navigation. The polarity
of the magnet, an ancient possession of the
Chinese, had been known perhaps for three
hundred years, when this new spirit of discovery
awoke in the fifteenth century. The Indian
Ocean and its traditions were to impart, perhaps
through the Arabs, perhaps through the returning
Crusaders, a knowledge of the magnet to the
dwellers on the shores of the Mediterranean, and
to the hardier mariners who had pushed beyond
the pillars of Hercules, so that the new route to
that same Indian Ocean was made possible in
the fifteenth century. The way was prepared
for it gradually. The Catalans from the port of
Barcelona pushed out into the great Sea of Darkness
under the direction of their needles, as early
at least as the twelfth century. The pilots of
Genoa and Venice, the hardy Majorcans and the
adventurous Moors, were followers of almost
equal temerity.</p>

<p>A knowledge of the variation of the needle
came more slowly to be known to the mariners
of the Mediterranean. It had been observed by
Peregrini as early as 1269, but that knowledge
of it which rendered it greatly serviceable in
voyages does not seem to be plainly indicated
in any of the charts of these transition centuries,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
till we find it laid down on the maps of Andrea
Bianco in 1436.</p>

<p>It was no new thing then when Columbus, as he
sailed westward, marked the variation, proceeding
from the northeast more and more westerly;
but it was a revelation when he came to a position
where the magnetic north and the north star
stood in conjunction, as they did on this 13th of
September, 1492. As he still moved westerly
the magnetic line was found to move farther and
farther away from the pole as it had before the
13th approached it. To an observer of Columbus's
quick perceptions, there was a ready guess
to possess his mind. This inference was that
this line of no variation was a meridian line, and
that divergence from it east and west might have
a regularity which would be found to furnish
a method of ascertaining longitude far easier
and surer than tables or water clocks. We know
that four years later he tried to sail his ship on
observations of this kind. The same idea seems
to have occurred to Sebastian Cabot, when a
little afterwards he approached and passed in a
higher latitude, what he supposed to be the
meridian of no variation. Humboldt is inclined
to believe that the possibility of such a method
of ascertaining longitude was that uncommunicable
secret, which Sebastian Cabot many years
later hinted at on his death-bed.</p>

<p>The claim was made near a century later by
Livio Sanuto in his <i>Geographia</i>, published at
Venice, in 1588, that Sebastian Cabot had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the first to observe this variation, and had explained
it to Edward VI., and that he had on a
chart placed the line of no variation at a point
one hundred and ten miles west of the island of
Flores in the Azores.</p>

<p>These observations of Columbus and Cabot
were not wholly accepted during the sixteenth
century. Robert Hues, in 1592, a hundred
years later, tells us that Medina, the Spanish
grand pilot, was not disinclined to believe that
mariners saw more in it than really existed and
that they found it a convenient way to excuse
their own blunders. Nonius was credited with
saying that it simply meant that worn-out magnets
were used, which had lost their power to
point correctly to the pole. Others had contended
that it was through insufficient application
of the loadstone to the iron that it was so
devious in its work.</p>

<p>What was thought possible by the early
navigators possessed the minds of all seamen in
varying experiments for two centuries and a half.
Though not reaching such satisfactory results
as were hoped for, the expectation did not prove
so chimerical as was sometimes imagined when
it was discovered that the lines of variation were
neither parallel, nor straight, nor constant. The
line of no variation which Columbus found near
the Azores had moved westward with erratic
inclinations, until to-day it is not far from a
straight line from Carolina to Guinea. Science,
beginning with its crude efforts at the hands of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Alonzo de Santa Cruz, in 1530, has so mapped
the surface of the globe with observations of its
multifarious freaks of variation, and the changes
are so slow, that a magnetic chart is not a bad
guide to-day for ascertaining the longitude in
any latitude for a few years neighbouring to the
date of its records. So science has come around
in some measure to the dreams of Columbus and
Cabot.</p>

<p>But this was not the only development which
came from this ominous day in the mid-Atlantic
in that September of 1492. The fancy of Columbus
was easily excited, and notions of a change
of climate, and even aberration of the stars were
easily imagined by him amid the strange phenomena
of that untracked waste.</p>

<p>While Columbus was suspecting that the north
star was somewhat wilfully shifting from the
magnetic pole, now to a distance of 5&deg; and then
of 10&deg;, the calculations of modern astronomers
have gauged the polar distance existing in 1492
at 3&deg; 28&acute;, as against the 1&deg; 20&acute; of to-day. The
confusion of Columbus was very like his confounding
an old world with a new, inasmuch as
he supposed it was the pole star and not the
needle which was shifting.</p>

<p>He argued from what he saw, or what he
thought he saw, that the line of no variation
marked the beginning of a protuberance of the
earth, up which he ascended as he sailed westerly,
and that this was the reason of the cooler weather
which he experienced. He never got over some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
notions of this kind, and he believed he found confirmation
of them in his later voyages.</p>

<p>Even as early as the reign of Edward III. of
England, Nicholas of Lynn, a voyager to the
northern seas, is thought to have definitely fixed
the magnetic pole in the Arctic regions, transmitting
his views to Cnoyen, the master of the
later Mercator, in respect to the four circumpolar
islands, which in the sixteenth century made so
constant a surrounding of the north pole.</p>

<p>The next day (September 14), after these magnetic
observations, a water wagtail was seen
from the <i>Nina</i>,&mdash;a bird which Columbus thought
unaccustomed to fly over twenty-five leagues
from land, and the ships were now, according to
their reckoning, not far from two hundred leagues
from the Canaries. On Saturday they saw a
distant bolt of fire fall into the sea. On Sunday,
they had a drizzling rain, followed by pleasant
weather, which reminded Columbus of the nightingales,
gladdening the climate of Andalusia in
April. They found around the ships much green
floatage of weeds, which led them to think some
islands must be near. Navarrete thinks there
was some truth in this, inasmuch as the charts
of the early part of this century represent breakers
as having been seen in 1802, near the spot where
Columbus can be computed to have been at this
time. Columbus was in fact within that extensive
<i>prairie</i> of floating seaweed which is known
as the Sargasso Sea, whose principal longitudinal
axis is found in modern times to lie along the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
parallel of 41&deg; 30&acute;, and the best calculations
which can be made from the rather uncertain
data of Columbus's journal seem to point to
about the same position.</p>

<p>There is nothing in all these accounts, as we
have them abridged by La Casas, to indicate any
great surprise, and certainly nothing of the overwhelming
fear which, the <i>Historie</i> tells us, the
sailors experienced when they found their ships
among these floating masses of weeds, raising
apprehension of a perpetual entanglement in
their swashing folds.</p>

<p>The next day (September 17) the currents
became favourable, and the weeds still floated
about them. The variation of the needle now
became so great that the seamen were dismayed,
as the journal says, and the observation being
repeated Columbus practised another deceit
and made it appear that there had been really
no variation, but only a shifting of the polar star!
The weeds were now judged to be river weeds,
and a live crab was found among them,&mdash;a sure
sign of near land, as Columbus believed, or
affected to believe. They killed a tunny and
saw others. They again observed a water wagtail,
&ldquo;which does not sleep at sea.&rdquo; Each ship
pushed on for the advance, for it was thought
the goal was near. The next day the <i>Pinta</i> shot
ahead and saw great flocks of birds towards the
west. Columbus conceived that the sea was growing,
fresher. Heavy clouds hung on the northern
horizon, a sure sign of land, it was supposed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>On the next day two pelicans came on board,
and Columbus records that these birds are not
accustomed to go twenty leagues from land.
So he sounded with a line of two hundred fathoms
to be sure he was not approaching land; but no
bottom was found. A drizzling rain also betokened
land, which they could not stop to find,
but would search for on their return, as the journal
says. The pilots now compared their reckonings.
Columbus said they were 400 leagues,
while the <i>Pinta's</i> record showed 420, and the
<i>Nina's</i> 440.</p>

<p>On September 20 other pelicans came on board;
and the ships were again among the weeds.
Columbus was determined to ascertain if these
indicated shoal water and sounded, but could
not reach bottom. The men caught a bird with
feet like a gull; but they were convinced it was
a river bird. Then singing land birds, as was
fancied, hovered about as it darkened, but they
disappeared before morning. Then a pelican
was observed flying to the southwest, and as
&ldquo;these birds sleep on shore, and go to sea in the
morning,&rdquo; the men encouraged themselves with
the belief that they could not be far from land.
The next day a whale could be but another
indication of land; and the weeds covered the sea
all about. On Saturday, they steered west by
northwest, and got clear of the weeds. This
change of course so far to the north, which had
begun on the previous day, was occasioned by a
head wind, and Columbus says he welcomed it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
because it had the effect of convincing the sailors
that westerly winds to return by were not impossible.
On Sunday (September 23), they
found the wind still varying; but they made
more westering than before,&mdash;weeds, crabs, and
birds still about them. Now there was
smooth water, which again depressed the seamen;
then the sea arose, mysteriously, for there
was no wind to cause it. They still kept their
course westerly and continued it till the night of
September 25.</p>

<p>Columbus at this time conferred with Pinzon,
as to a chart which they carried, which showed
some islands, near where they now supposed the
ships to be. That they had not seen land, they
believed was either due to currents which had
carried them too far north, or else their reckoning
was not correct. At sunset Pinzon hailed the
Admiral, and said he saw land, claiming the
reward. The two crews were confident that such
was the case, and under the lead of their commanders
they all kneeled and repeated the
<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>. The land appeared to lie
southwest, and everybody saw the apparition.
Columbus changed the fleet's course to reach it;
and as the vessels went on, in the smooth sea,
the men had the heart, under their expectation,
to bathe in its amber glories. On Wednesday,
they were undeceived, and found that the clouds
had played them a trick. On the 27th their
course lay more directly west. So they went on,
and still remarked upon all the birds they saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and weed-drift which they pierced. Some of the
fowl they thought to be such as were common
at the Cape Verde Islands, and were not supposed
to go far to sea. On the 30th of September, they
still observed the needles of their compasses to
vary, but the journal records that it was the pole
star which moved, and not the needle. On
October 1, Columbus says they were 707 leagues
from Ferro; but he had made his crew believe
they were only 584. As they went on, little
new for the next few days is recorded in the
journal; but on October 3, they thought they
saw among the weeds something like fruits.
By the 6th, Pinzon began to urge a southwesterly
course, in order to find the islands, which the
signs seemed to indicate in that direction. Still
the Admiral would not swerve from his purpose,
and kept his course westerly. On Sunday the
<i>Nina</i> fired a bombard and hoisted a flag as a
signal that she saw land, but it proved a delusion.
Observing towards evening a flock of birds flying
to the southwest, the Admiral yielded to Pinzon's
belief, and shifted his course to follow the
birds. He records as a further reason for it that
it was by following the flights of birds that the
Portuguese had been so successful in discovering
islands in other seas.</p>

<p>Columbus now found himself two hundred
miles and more farther than the three thousand
miles west of Spain, where he supposed Cipango
to lie, and he was 25&frac12;&deg; north of the equator,
according to his astrolabe. The true distance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of Cipango or Japan was sixty-eight hundred
miles still farther, or beyond both North America
and the Pacific. How much beyond that island,
in its supposed geographical position, Columbus
expected to find the Asiatic main we can only
conjecture from the restorations which modern
scholars have made of Toscanelli's map, which
makes the island about 10&deg; east of Asia,
and from Behaim's globe, which makes it 20&deg;.
It should be borne in mind that the knowledge
of its position came from Marco Polo, and he does
not distinctly say how far it was from the Asiatic
coast. In a general way, as to these distances
from Spain to China, Toscanelli and Behaim
agreed, and there is no reason to believe that the
views of Columbus were in any noteworthy
degree different.</p>

<p>In the trial years afterward, when the Fiscal
contested the rights of Diego Colon, it was put
in evidence by one Vallejo, a seaman, that Pinzon
was induced to urge the direction to be
changed to the southwest, because he had in the
preceding evening observed a flight of parrots
in that direction, which could have only been
seeking land. It was the main purpose of the
evidence in this part of the trial to show that
Pinzon had all along forced Columbus forward
against his will.</p>

<p>How pregnant this change of course in the
vessels of Columbus was has not escaped the
observation of Humboldt and many others.
A day or two further on his westerly way, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the Gulf Stream would, perhaps, insensibly have
borne the little fleet up the Atlantic coast of the
future United States, so that the banner of Castile
might have been planted at Carolina.</p>

<p>On the 7th of October, Columbus was pretty
nearly in latitude 25&deg; 50&acute;,&mdash;that of one of the
Bahama Islands. Just where he was by longitude
there is much more doubt, probably between
65&deg; and 66&deg;. On the next day the land
birds flying along the course of the ships seemed
to confirm their hopes. On the 10th the journal
records that the men began to lose patience; but
the Admiral reassured them by reminding them
of the profits in store for them, and of the folly
of seeking to return when they had already gone
so far.</p>

<p>It is possible that, in this entry, Columbus
conceals the story which came out later in the
recital of Oviedo, with more detail than in the
<i>Historie</i> and Las Casas, that the rebellion of his
crew was threatening enough to oblige him to
promise to turn back if land was not discovered
in three days. Most commentators, however,
are inclined to think that this story of a mutinous
revolt was merely engrafted from hearsay or
other source by Oviedo upon the more genuine
recital, and that the conspiracy to throw the
Admiral into the sea has no substantial basis in
contemporary report. Irving, who has a dramatic
tendency throughout his whole account
of the voyage to heighten his recital with touches
of the imagination, nevertheless allows this, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
thinks that Oviedo was misled by listening to a
pilot, who was a personal enemy of the Admiral.</p>

<p>The elucidations of the voyage which were
drawn out in the famous suit of Diego with the
Crown in 1513 and 1515, afford no ground for
any belief in this story of the mutiny and the
concession of Columbus to it.</p>

<p>It is not, however, difficult to conceive the
recurrent fears of his men and the incessant
anxiety of Columbus to quiet them. From
what Peter Martyr tells us,&mdash;and he may have
got it directly from Columbus's lips,&mdash;the task
was not an easy one to preserve subordination
and to instil confidence. He represents that
Columbus was forced to resort in turn to argument,
persuasion and enticements, and to picture
the misfortunes of the royal displeasure.</p>

<p>The next day, notwithstanding a heavier sea
than they had before encountered, certain signs
sufficed to lift them out of their despondency.
These were floating logs, or pieces of wood, one
of them apparently carved by hand, bits of cane,
a green rush, a stalk of rose berries and other
drifting tokens.</p>

<p>Their southwesterly course had now brought
them down to about the twenty-fourth parallel,
when after sunset on the 11th they shifted
their course to due west, while the crew of the
Admiral's ship united, with more fervour than
usual, in the <i>Salve Regina</i>. At about ten o'clock
Columbus, peering into the night, thought he
saw&mdash;if we may believe him&mdash;a moving light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
and pointing out the direction to Pero Gutierrez,
this companion saw it too; but another, Rodrigo
Sanchez, situated apparently on another part
of the vessel, was not able to see it. It was not
brought to the attention of any others. The
Admiral says that the light seemed to be moving
up and down, and he claimed to have got
other glimpses of its glimmer at a later moment.
He ordered the <i>Salve</i> to be chanted, and directed
a vigilant watch to be set on the forecastle.
To sharpen their vision he promised a silken
jacket, beside the income of ten thousand
maravedis which the King and Queen had
offered to the fortunate man who should first
descry the coveted land.</p>

<p>This light has been the occasion of such comment,
and nothing will ever, it is likely, be settled
about it, further than that the Admiral, with
an inconsiderate rivalry of a common sailor,
who later saw the actual land, and with an
ungenerous assurance, ill-befitting a commander,
pocketed a reward which belonged to another.
If Oviedo, with his prejudices, is to be believed,
Columbus was not even the first who claimed
to have seen this dubious light. There is a common
story that the poor sailor, who was defrauded,
later turned Mohammedan and went
to live among that juster people. There is a
sort of retributive justice in the fact that the
pension of the Crown was made a charge upon
the shambles of Seville, and thence Columbus
received it till he died.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the light is to be considered a reality
or a fiction will depend much on the theory
each may hold regarding the position of the
landfall. When Columbus claimed to have discovered
it, he was twelve or fourteen leagues
away from the island, where four hours later
land was indubitably found. Was the light
on a canoe? Was it on some small, outlying
island, as has been suggested? Was it a torch
carried from hut to hut, as Herrera avers?
Was it on either of the other vessels? Was it
on the low island on which, the next morning
he landed? There was no elevation on that
island sufficient to show even a strong light
at a distance of ten leagues. Was it a fancy
or a deceit? No one can say. It is very difficult
for Navarrete, and even for Irving, to rest satisfied
with what after all may have been only
an illusion of a fevered mind, making a record
of the incident in the excitement of a wonderful
hour, when his intelligence was not as circumspect
as it might have been.</p>

<p>Four hours after the light was seen, at two
o'clock in the morning, when the moon, near its
third quarter, was in the east, the <i>Pinta</i>, keeping
ahead, one of her sailors, Rodrigo de Triane
descried the land two leagues away, and a gun
communicated the joyful intelligence to the
other ships. The fleet took in sail, and each
vessel, under backed canvas, was pointed to the
wind. Thus they waited for daybreak. It was
a proud moment of painful suspense for Columbus;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and brimming hopes, perhaps fears of disappointment,
must have accompanied that hour
of wavering enchantment. It was Friday,
October 12, of the old chronology, and the
little fleet had been thirty-three days on its
way from the Canaries, and we must add ten
days more to complete the period since they
left Palos. The land before them was seen, as
the day dawned, to be a small island, &ldquo;called
in the Indian tongue&rdquo; Guanahani. Some naked
natives were descried. The Admiral and the
commanders of the other vessels prepared to
land. Columbus took the royal standard and
the others each a banner of the green cross,
which bore the initials of the sovereign with a
cross between, a crown surmounting every
letter. Thus, with the emblems of their power,
and accompanied by Rodrigo de Escoveda and
Rodrigo Sanchez and some seamen, the boat
rowed to the shore. They immediately took
formal possession of the land, and the notary
recorded it.</p>

<p>The words of the prayer usually given as
uttered by Columbus on taking possession of
San Salvador, when he named the island, cannot
be traced farther back than a collection
of <i>Tablas Chronologicas</i>, got together at Valencia
in 1689, by a Jesuit father, Claudio Clemente.
Harrisse finds no authority for the statement
of the French canonizers that Columbus established
a form of prayer which was long in
vogue, for such occupations of new lands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Las Casas, from whom we have the best account
of the ceremonies of the landing, does
not mention it; but we find pictured in his
pages the grave impressiveness of the hour;
the form of Columbus, with a crimson robe
over his armour, central and grand; and the
humbleness of his followers in their contrition
for the hours of their faint-heartedness.</p>

<p>Columbus now enters in his journal his impressions
of the island and its inhabitants.
He says of the land that it bore green trees, was
watered by many streams, and produced divers
fruits. In another place he speaks of the island
as flat, without lofty eminence, surrounded by
reefs, with a lake in the interior.</p>

<p>The courses and distances of his sailing both
before and on leaving the island, as well as
this description, are the best means we have of
identifying the spot of this portentous landfall.
The early maps may help in a subsidiary way,
but with little precision.</p>

<p>There is just enough uncertainty and contradiction
respecting the data and arguments
applied in the solution of this question, to render
it probable that men will never quite agree
which of the Bahamas it was upon which these
startled and exultant Europeans first stepped.
Though Las Casas reports the journal of Columbus
unabridged for a period after the landfall,
he unfortunately condenses it for some time
previous. There is apparently no chance of
finding geographical conditions that in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
respect will agree with this record of Columbus,
and we must content ourselves with what offers
the fewest disagreements. An obvious method,
if we could depend on Columbus's dead reckoning,
would be to see for what island the actual
distance from the Canaries would be nearest
to his computed run; but currents and errors
of the eye necessarily throw this sort of computation
out of the question, and Captain G.
A. Fox, who has tried it, finds that Cat Island
is three hundred and seventeen, the Grand Turk
six hundred and twenty-four nautical miles, and
the other supposable points at intermediate distances
out of the way as compared with his
computation of the distance run by Columbus,
three thousand four hundred and fifty-eight of
such miles.</p>

<p>The reader will remember the Bahama group
as a range of islands, islets, and rocks, said to be
some three thousand in number, running southeast
from a point part way up the Florida
coast, and approaching at the other end the
coast of Hispaniola. In the latitude of the lower
point of Florida, and five degrees east of it, is
the island of San Salvador or Cat Island, which
is the most northerly of those claimed to have
been the landfall of Columbus. Proceeding
down the group, we encounter Watling's, Samana,
Acklin (with the Plana Cays), Mariguana,
and the Grand Turk,&mdash;all of which have their
advocates. The three methods of identification
which have been followed are, first, by plotting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the outward track; second, by plotting the
track between the landfall and Cuba, both
forward and backward; third, by applying the
descriptions, particularly Columbus's, of the
island first seen. In this last test, Harrisse prefers
to apply the description of Las Casas,
which is borrowed in part from that of the
<i>Historie</i>, and he reconciles Columbus's apparent
discrepancy when he says in one place that the
island was &ldquo;pretty large,&rdquo; and in another
&ldquo;small,&rdquo; by supposing that he may have applied
these opposite terms, the lesser to the Plana
Cays, as first seen, and the other to the Crooked
Group, or Acklin Island, lying just westerly,
on which he may have landed. Harrisse is the
only one who makes this identification; and
he finds some confirmation in later maps,
which show thereabout an island, Triango or
Triangulo, a name said by Las Casas to have
been applied to Guanahani at a later day.
There is no known map earlier than 1540
bearing this alternative name of Triango.</p>

<p>San Salvador seems to have been the island
selected by the earliest of modern inquirers in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and
it has had the support of Irving and Humboldt
in later times. Captain Alexander Slidell
Mackenzie of the United States navy worked
out the problem for Irving. It is much larger
than any of the other islands, and could hardly
have been called by Columbus in any alternative
way a &ldquo;small&rdquo; island, while it does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
answer Columbus's description of being level,
having on it an eminence of four hundred feet,
and no interior lagoon, as his Guanahani demands.
The French canonizers stand by the
old traditions, and find it meet to say that &ldquo;the
English Protestants not finding the name of
San Salvador fine enough have substituted for
it that of Cat, and in their hydrographical
atlases the Island of the Holy Saviour is nobly
called Cat Island.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The weight of modern testimony seems to
favour Watling's Island, and it so far answers
Columbus's description that about one-third of
its interior is water, corresponding to his &ldquo;large
lagoon.&rdquo; Mu&ntilde;oz first suggested it in 1793; but
the arguments in its favour were first spread out
by Captain Becher of the royal navy in 1856,
and he seems to have induced Oscar Peschel
in 1858 to adopt the same views in his history
of the range of modern discovery. Major, the
map custodian of the British Museum, who had
previously followed Navarrete in favouring the
Grand Turk, again addressed himself to the
problem in 1870, and fell into line with the
adherents of Watling's. No other considerable
advocacy of this island, if we except the testimony
of Gerard Stein in 1883, in a book on
voyages of discovery, appeared till Lieutenant
J. B. Murdoch, an officer of the American
navy, made a very careful examination of the
subject in the <i>Proceedings of the United States
Naval Institute</i> in 1884, which is accepted by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
Charles A. Schott in the <i>Bulletin of the United
States Coast Survey</i>. Murdoch was the first to
plot in a backward way the track between
Guanahani and Cuba, and he finds more points
of resemblance in Columbus's description with
Watling's than with any other. The latest
adherent is the eminent geographer, Clements
R. Markham, in the bulletin of the Italian
Geographical Society in 1889. Perhaps no
cartographical argument has been so effective
as that of Major in comparing modern charts
with the map of Herrera, in which the latter
lays Guanahani down.</p>

<p>An elaborate attempt to identity Samana as
the landfall was made by the late Captain
Gustavus Vasa Fox, in an appendix to the
<i>Report of the United States Coast Survey</i> for
1880. Varnhagen, in 1864, selected Mariguana,
and defended his choice in a paper. This island
fails to satisfy the physical conditions in being
without interior water. Such a qualification,
however, belongs to the Grand Turk Island,
which was advocated first by Navarrete in
1826, whose views have since been supported
by George Gibbs, and for a while by Major.</p>

<p>It is rather curious to note that Caleb Cushing,
who undertook to examine this question
in the <i>North American Review</i>, under the guidance
of Navarrete's theory, tried the same
backward method which has been later applied
to the problem, but with quite different results
from those reached by more recent investigators.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
He says, &ldquo;By setting out from Nipe
which is the point where Columbus struck
Cuba and proceeding in a retrograde direction
along his course, we may surely trace his path,
and shall be convinced that Guanahani is no
other than Turk's Island.&rdquo;</p>

appearing to be too great for the loaded canoes,
all those who could not swim were sent with
the baggage by land. The canoes then passed
safely down and were reloaded. At the foot of
the rapid we took a meridian altitude and found
our latitude to be 59&deg; 45&acute; 45".&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>This rapid forms the last of the descents of
the Columbia; and immediately below it the
river widens, and tidewater commences. Shortly
after starting they passed an island three miles
in length and to which, from that plant being
seen on it in great abundance, they gave the
name of Strawberry Island. Directly beyond
were three small islands, and in the meadow
to the right, at some distance from the hills
in the background was a single perpendicular
rock, which they judged to be no less than
eight hundred feet high and four hundred
yards at the base, which they called Beacon
Rock. A little farther on they found the river
a mile in breadth, and double this breadth four
miles beyond. After making twenty-nine miles
from the foot of the Great Shoot, they halted
for the night at a point where the river was
two and a half miles wide. The character of the
country they had passed through during the
day was very different from that they had
lately been accustomed to, the hills being thickly
covered with timber, chiefly of the pine species.
The tide rose at their encampment about nine
inches, and they saw great numbers of water-fowl,
such as swan, geese, ducks of various
kinds, gulls, etc.</p>

<p>The next day, <i>November 3d</i>, they set off in
company with some Indians who had joined
them the evening before. At the distance of
three miles they passed a river on the left, to
which, from the quantity of sand it bears along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with it, they gave the name of Quicksand
River. So great, indeed, was the quantity it
had discharged into the Columbia, that the
river was compressed to the width of half a
mile, and the whole force of the current thrown
against the right shore. Opposite this was a
large creek, which they called Seal River. The
mountain which they had supposed to be the
Mount Hood of Vancouver, now bore S. 85&deg;
E., about forty-seven miles distant. About
three miles farther on they passed the lower
mouth of Quicksand River, opposite to which
was another large creek, and near it the head
of an island three miles and a half in extent;
and half a mile beyond it was another island,
which they called Diamond Island, opposite
to which they encamped, having made but thirteen
miles' distance. Here they met with some
Indians ascending the river, who stated that they
had seen three vessels at its mouth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Below Quicksand River,&rdquo; says the Journal,
&ldquo;the country is low, rich, and thickly wooded
on each side of the Columbia; the islands have
less timber, and on them are numerous ponds,
near which were vast quantities of fowl, such
as swan, geese, brant, cranes, storks, white-gulls,
cormorants, and plover. The river is
wide and contains a great number of sea-otters.
In the evening the hunters brought in
game for a sumptuous supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In continuing their descent the next day,
they found Diamond Island to be six miles in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
length and three broad; and near its termination
were two other islands. &ldquo;Just below the
last of these,&rdquo; proceeds the narrative, &ldquo;we
landed on the left bank of the river, at a village
of twenty-five houses, all of which were thatched
with straw, and built of bark except one, which
was about fifty feet long and constructed of
boards, in the form of those higher up the river,
from which it differed, however, in being completely
above ground, and covered with broad,
split boards. This village contained about two
hundred men of the Skilloot nation, who seemed
well provided with canoes, of which there were
at least fifty-two, and some of them very large,
drawn up in front of the village. On landing,
we found an Indian from above, who had left
us this morning, and who now invited us
into a lodge of which he appeared to be part
owner. Here he treated us with a root, round
in shape and about the size of a small Irish
potato, which they call <i>wappatoo</i>: it is the common
arrow-head or <i>sagittifolia</i> so much cultivated
by the Chinese, and, when roasted in the
embers till it becomes soft, has an agreeable
taste, and is a very good substitute for bread.
After purchasing some of this root we resumed
our journey, and at seven miles' distance came
to the head of a large island near the left bank.
On the right shore was a fine open prairie for
about a mile, back of which the country rises,
and is well supplied with timber, such as white
oak, pine of different kinds, wild crab, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
several species of undergrowth, while along the
borders of the river there were only a few
cottonwood and ash trees. In this prairie were
also signs of deer and elk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we landed for dinner a number of
Indians came down, for the purpose, as we supposed,
of paying us a friendly visit, as they
had put on their finest dresses. In addition to
their usual covering, they had scarlet and blue
blankets, sailor's jackets and trowsers, shirts,
and hats. They had all of them either war-axes,
spears, and bows and arrows, or muskets
and pistols, with tin powder-flasks. We smoked
with them, and endeavoured to show them
every attention, but soon found them very
assuming and disagreeable companions. While
we were eating, they stole the pipe with which
they were smoking, and a great coat of one of
the men. We immediately searched them all,
and found the coat stuffed under the root of a
tree near where they were sitting; but the pipe
we could not recover. Finding us discontented
with them, and determined not to suffer any
imposition, they showed their displeasure in the
only way they dared, by returning in ill humour
to their village. We then proceeded, and soon
met two canoes, with twelve men of the same
Skilloot nation, who were on their way from
below. The larger of the canoes was ornamented
with the figures of a bear in the bow and a man
in the stern, both nearly as large as life, both
made of painted wood, and very neatly fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to the boat. In the same canoe were two Indians
gaudily dressed, and with round hats. This
circumstance induced us to give the name of
Image Canoe to the large island, the lower end
of which we were now passing, at the distance
of nine miles from its head. We had seen two
smaller islands to the right, and three more
near its lower extremity.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;The river
was now about a mile and a half in width, with
a gentle current, and the bottoms extensive and
low, but not subject to be overflowed. Three
miles below Image Canoe Island we came to
four large houses on the left side; here we had
a full view of the mountain which we had first
seen from the Muscleshell Rapid on the 19th
of October, and which we now found to be,
in fact, the Mount St. Helen of Vancouver. It
bore north 25&deg; east, about ninety miles distant,
rose in the form of a sugar loaf to a very great
height, and was covered with snow. A mile
lower we passed a single house on the left,
and another on the right. The Indians had
now learned so much of us that their curiosity
was without any mixture of fear, and their
visits became very frequent and troublesome.
We therefore continued on till after night, in
hopes of getting rid of them; but, after passing
a village on each side, which, on account of the
lateness of the hour, we could only see indistinctly,
we found there was no escaping from
their importunities. We accordingly landed at
the distance of seven miles below Image Canoe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Island, and encamped near a single house on
the right, having made during the day twenty-nine
miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Skilloots that we passed to-day speak
a language somewhat different from that of
the Echeloots or Chilluckittequaws near the long
narrows. Their dress, however, is similar, except
that the Skilloots possess more articles
procured from the white traders; and there is
this farther difference between them, that the
Skilloots, both males and females, have the
head flattened. Their principal food is fish,
<i>wappatoo</i> roots, and some elk and deer, in killing
which, with arrows they seem to be very
expert; for during the short time we remained
at the village three deer were brought in. We
also observed there a tame <i>blaireau</i> [badger].&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as we landed we were visited by
two canoes loaded with Indians, from whom
we purchased a few roots. The grounds along
the river continued low and rich, and among
the shrubs were large quantities of vines resembling
the raspberry. On the right the low grounds
were terminated at the distance of five miles
by a range of high hills covered with tall timber,
and running southeast and northwest.
The game, as usual, was very abundant; and,
among other birds, we observed some white
geese, with a part of their wings black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early the next morning they resumed their
voyage, passing several islands in the course
of the day, the river alternately widening and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
contracting, and the hills sometimes retiring
from, and at others approaching, its banks.
They stopped for the night at the distance of
thirty-two miles from their last encampment.
&ldquo;Before landing,&rdquo; proceeds the Journal, &ldquo;we
met two canoes, the largest of which had at
the bow the image of a bear, and that of a man
on the stern: there were twenty-six Indians
on board, but they proceeded upwards, and
we were left, for the first time since we reached
the waters of the Columbia, without any of the
natives with us during the night. Besides other
game, we killed a grouse much larger than the
common kind, and observed along the shore
a number of striped snakes. The river is here
deep, and about a mile and a half in width.
Here, too, the ridge of low mountains, running
northwest and southeast, crosses the river and
forms the western boundary of the plain through
which we had just passed. This great plain or
valley begins above the mouth of Quicksand
River, and is about sixty miles long in a straight
line, while on the right and left it extends to
a great distance; it is a fertile and delightful
country, shaded by thick groves of tall timber,
and watered by small ponds on both sides of
the river. The soil is rich and capable of any
species of culture; but in the present condition
of the Indians, its chief production is the <i>wappatoo</i>
root, which grows spontaneously and exclusively
in this region. Sheltered as it is on
both sides, the temperature is much milder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
than that of the surrounding country; for even
at this season of the year we observed but very
little appearance of frost. It is inhabited by
numerous tribes of Indians, who either reside
in it permanently, or visits its waters in quest
of fish and <i>wappatoo</i> roots. We gave it the
name of the Columbia Valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 6.</i> The morning was cool and
rainy. We proceeded at an early hour between
high hills on both sides of the river, till at the
distance of four miles we came to two tents
of Indians in a small plain on the left, where
the hills on the right recede a few miles, and a
long, narrow inland stretches along the right
shore. Behind this island is the mouth of a
large river, a hundred and fifty yards wide,
called by the Indians Coweliske. We halted
on the island for dinner, but the redwood and
green briers were so interwoven with the pine,
alder, ash, a species of beech, and other trees,
that the woods formed a thicket which our
hunters could not penetrate. Below the mouth
of the Coweliske a very remarkable knob rises
from the water's edge to the height of eighty
feet, being two hundred paces round the base;
and as it is in a low part of the island, and at
some distance from the high grounds, its appearance
is very singular. On setting out after
dinner we overtook two canoes going down to
trade. One of the Indians, who spoke a few
words of English, mentioned that the principal
person who traded with them was a Mr. Haley;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and he showed us a bow of iron and several
other things, which he said he had given him.
Nine miles below Coweliske River is a creek
on the same side; and between them three
smaller islands, one on the left shore, the other
about the middle of the river, and a third near,
the lower end of the long, narrow island, and
opposite a high cliff of black rocks on the left,
sixteen miles from our last night's encampment.
Here we were overtaken by some Indians
from the two tents we had passed in the morning,
from whom we purchased <i>wappatoo</i> roots,
salmon, trout, and two beaver-skins, for which
last we gave five small fish-hooks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the mountains which had been high
and rugged on the left, retired from the river,
as had the hills on the right, since leaving the
Coweliske, and a beautiful plain was spread
out before them. They met with several islands
on their way, and having at the distance of
five miles come to the termination of the plain,
they proceeded for eight miles through a hilly
country, and encamped for the night after
having made twenty-nine miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 7.</i> The morning,&rdquo; proceeds the
narrative, &ldquo;was rainy, and the fog so thick
that we could not see across the river. We
observed, however, opposite to our camp,
the upper point of an island, between which
and the steep hills on the right we proceeded
for five miles. Three miles lower was the beginning
of an island, separated from the right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
shore by a narrow channel: down this we proceeded
under the direction of some Indians
whom we had just met going up the river,
and who returned in order to show us their
village. It consisted of four houses only, situated
on this channel, behind several marshy islands
formed by two small creeks. On our arrival
they gave us some fish, and we afterwards
purchased <i>wappatoo</i> roots, fish, three dogs, and
two otter-skins, for which we gave fish-hooks
chiefly, that being an article which they are
very anxious to obtain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These people seemed to be of a different
nation from those we had just passed: they
were low in stature, ill-shaped, and all had
their heads flattened. They called themselves
Wahkiacum, and their language differed from
that of the tribes above, with whom they trade
for <i>wappatoo</i> roots. The houses, too, were built
in a different style, being raised entirely above
ground, with the eaves about five feet high,
and the door at the corner. Near the end opposite
to the door was a single fireplace, round
which were the beds, raised four feet from the
floor of earth; over the fire were hung fresh fish,
and when dried they are stowed away with the
<i>wappatoo</i> roots under the beds. The dress of
the men was like that of the people above; but
the women were clad in a peculiar manner,
the robe not reaching lower than the hip, and
the body being covered in cold weather by a
sort of corset of fur, curiously plaited, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
reaching from the arms to the hip: added to
this was a sort of petticoat, or, rather, tissue
of white cedar bark, bruised or broken into
small strands and woven into a girdle by several
cords of the same material. Being tied
round the middle, these strands hang down
as low as the knee in front and to the middle
of the leg behind: sometimes the tissue consists
of strings of silk-grass, twisted and knotted
at the end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After remaining with them about an hour,
we proceeded down the channel with an Indian
dressed in a sailor's jacket for our pilot; and,
on reaching the main channel, were visited by
some Indians, who have a temporary residence
on a marshy island, Tenasillihee, in the middle
of the river, where there are great numbers of
water-fowl. Here the mountainous country
again approaches the river on the left, and a
higher saddle mountain is perceived towards
the southwest. At a distance of twenty miles
from our camp we halted at a village of Wahkiacums,
consisting of seven ill-looking houses,
built in the same form with those above, and
situated at the foot of the high hills on the right,
behind two small marshy islands. We merely
stopped to purchase some food and two beaver
skins, and then proceeded. Opposite to these
islands the hills on the left retire, and the river
widens into a kind of bay, crowded with low
islands, subject to be overflowed occasionally
by the tide. We had not gone far from this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
village when, the fog suddenly clearing away,
we were at last presented with a glorious sight
of the ocean&mdash;that ocean, the object of all our
labours, the reward of all our anxieties. This
animating sight exhilarated the spirits of all
the party, who were still more delighted on
hearing the distant roar of the breakers. We
went on with great cheerfulness along the high
mountainous country which bordered the right
bank: the shore, however, was so bold and
rocky that we could not, until a distance of
fourteen miles from the last village, find any
spot fit for an encampment. Having made
during the day thirty-four miles, we now spread
our mats on the ground, and passed the night
in the rain. Here we were joined by our small
canoe, which had been separated from us
during the fog this morning. Two Indians
from the last village also accompanied us to
the camp; but having detected them in stealing
a knife, they were sent off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 8.</i> It rained this morning; and,
having changed our clothing, which had been
wet by yesterday's rain, we set out at nine
o'clock. Immediately opposite our camp was a
pillar rock, at the distance of a mile in the river,
about twenty feet in diameter and fifty in
height, and towards the southwest some high
mountains, one of which was covered with snow
at the top. We proceeded past several low
islands in the bend or bay of the river to the
left, which were here five or six miles wide.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
On the right side we passed an old village,
and then, at the distance of three miles, entered
an inlet or niche, about six miles across, and
making a deep bend of nearly five miles into the
hills on the right shore, where it receives the
waters of several creeks. We coasted along this
inlet, which, from its little depth, we called
Shallow Bay, and at the bottom of it stopped
to dine, near the remains of an old village,
from which, however, we kept at a cautious
distance, as, like all these places, it was occupied
by a plentiful stock of fleas. At this place we
observed a number of fowl, among which we
killed a goose and two ducks exactly resembling
in appearance and flavour the canvas-back
duck of the Susquehanna. After dinner we took
advantage of the returning tide to go about
three miles to a point on the right, eight miles
distant from our camp; but here the water
ran so high and washed about our canoe so much
that several of the men became seasick. It was
therefore judged imprudent to proceed in the
present state of the weather, and we landed at
the point. Our situation here was extremely
uncomfortable: the high hills jutted in so closely
that there was not room for us to lie level,
nor to secure our baggage from the tide, and
the water of the river was too salty to be used;
but the waves increasing so much that we could
not move from the spot with safety, we fixed
ourselves on the beach left by the ebb-tide,
and, raising the baggage on poles, passed a disagreeable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
night, the rain during the day having
wet us completely, as, indeed, we had been for
some time past.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 9.</i> Fortunately, the tide did
not rise as high as our camp during the night;
but, being accompanied by high winds from
the south, the canoes, which we could not place
beyond its reach, were filled with water and
saved with much difficulty: our position was
exceedingly disagreeable; but, as it was impossible
to move from it, we waited for a change
of weather. It rained, however, during the
whole day, and at two o'clock in the afternoon
the flood-tide came in, accompanied by a high
wind from the south, which at about four
o'clock shifted to the southwest, and blew
almost a gale directly from the sea. Immense
waves now broke over the place where we were
and large trees, some of them five or six feet
through, which had been lodged on the point,
drifted over our camp, so that the utmost
vigilance of every man could scarcely save the
canoes from being crushed to pieces. We remained
in the water and were drenched with
rain during the rest of the day, our only sustenance
being some dried fish and the rain water
which we caught. Yet, though wet and cold,
and some of then sick from using salt water,
the men were cheerful and full of anxiety to
see more of the ocean. The rain continued all
night and the following morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 10</i>, the wind lulling and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
waves not being so high, we loaded our canoes
and proceeded. The mountains on the right are
here high, covered with timber, chiefly pine,
and descend with a bold and rocky shore to
the water. We went through a deep niche
and several inlets on the right, while on the
opposite side was a large bay, above which the
hills are close on the river. At the distance of
ten miles the wind rose from the northwest,
and the waves became so high that we were
forced to return two miles for a place where
we could unload with safety. Here we landed
at the mouth of a small run, and, having placed
our baggage on a pile of drifted logs, waited
until low water. The river then appearing
more calm, we started again; but, after going a
mile, found the waters too turbulent for our
canoes, and were obliged to put to shore. Here
we landed the baggage, and, having placed it on
a rock above the reach of the tide, encamped
on some drift logs, which formed the only place
where we could lie, the hills rising steep over
our heads to the height of five hundred feet.
All our baggage, as well as ourselves, was thoroughly
wet with rain, which did not cease
during the day; it continued, indeed, violently
through the night, in the course of
which the tide reached the logs on which we
lay, and set them afloat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 11.</i> The wind was still high
from the southwest, and drove the waves against
the shore with great fury; the rain, too, fell in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
torrents, and not only drenched us to the skin,
but loosened the stones on the hillsides, so
that they came rolling down upon us. In this
comfortless condition we remained all day, wet
and cold, and with nothing but dried fish to
satisfy our hunger; the canoes at the mercy of
the waves at one place, the baggage in another,
and the men scattered on floating logs, or sheltering
themselves in the crevices of the rocks and
hillsides. A hunter was despatched in the hope
of finding some game; but the hills were so
steep, and so covered with undergrowth and
fallen timber, that he could not proceed, and
was forced to return. About twelve o'clock
we were visited by five Indians in a canoe.
They came from the opposite side of the river,
above where we were, and their language much
resembled that of the Wahkiacums: they calling
themselves Cathlamahs. In person they were
small, ill-made, and badly clothed; though
one of them had on a sailor's jacket and pantaloons,
which, as he explained by signs, he had
received from the whites below the point. We
purchased from them thirteen red charr, a fish
which we found very excellent. After some
time they went on board their boat and crossed
the river, which is here five miles wide, through
a very heavy sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 12.</i> About three o'clock a tremendous
gale of wind arose, accompanied with
lightning, thunder, and hail; at six it lightened
up for a short time, but a violent rain soon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
began and lasted through the day. During the
storm one of our boats, secured by being sunk
with great quantities of stone, got loose, but,
drifting against a rock, was recovered without
having received much injury. Our situation
now became much more dangerous, for the
waves were driven with fury against the rocks
and trees, which till now had afforded us refuge:
we therefore took advantage of the low tide,
and moved about half a mile round a point
to a small brook, which we had not observed
before on account of the thick bushes and driftwood
which concealed its mouth. Here we
were more safe, but still cold and wet; our
clothes and bedding rotten as well as wet, our
baggage at a distance, and the canoes, our
only means of escape from this place, at the
mercy of the waves. Still, we continued to enjoy
good health, and even had the luxury of feasting
on some salmon and three salmon trout which
we caught in the brook. Three of the men
attempted to go round a point in our small
Indian canoe, but the high waves rendered
her quite unmanageable, these boats requiring
the seamanship of the natives to make them
live in so rough a sea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 13.</i> During the night we had
short intervals of fair weather, but it began to
rain in the morning and continued through the
day. In order to obtain a view of the country
below, Captain Clarke followed the course of
the brook, and with much fatigue, and after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
walking three miles, ascended the first spur
of the mountains. The whole lower country
he found covered with almost impenetrable
thickets of small pine, with which is mixed a
species of plant resembling arrow-wood, twelve
or fifteen feet high, with thorny stems, almost
interwoven with each other, and scattered
among the fern and fallen timber: there is also
a red berry, somewhat like the Solomon's seal,
which is called by the natives <i>solme</i>, and used
as an article of diet. This thick growth rendered
travelling almost impossible, and it was rendered
still more fatiguing by the abruptness of
the mountain, which was so steep as to oblige
him to draw himself up by means of the bushes.
The timber on the hills is chiefly of a large,
tall species of pine, many of the trees eight or
ten feet in diameter at the stump, and rising
sometimes more than one hundred feet in height.
The hail which fell two nights before was still
to be seen on the mountains; there was no
game, and no marks of any, except some old
tracks of elk. The cloudy weather prevented
his seeing to any distance, and he therefore
returned to camp and sent three men in an
Indian canoe to try if they could double the
point and find some safer harbour for our
boats. At every flood-tide the sea broke in
great swells against the rocks and drifted the
trees against our establishment, so as to render
it very insecure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 14.</i> It had rained without intermission<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
during the night and continued to
through the day; the wind, too, was very high,
and one of our canoes much injured by being
driven against the rocks. Five Indians from
below came to us in a canoe, and three of them
landed, and informed us that they had seen the
men sent down yesterday. Fortunately, at this
moment one of the men arrived, and told us
that these very Indians had stolen his gig and
basket; we therefore ordered the two women,
who remained in the canoe, to restore them;
but this they refused to do till we threatened
to shoot them, when they gave back the articles,
and we commanded them to leave us. They
were of the Wahkiacum nation. The man now
informed us that they had gone round the
point as far as the high sea would suffer them
in the canoe, and then landed; that in the night
he had separated from his companions, who
had proceeded farther down; and that, at no
great distance from where we were, was a
beautiful sand beach and a good harbour.
Captain Lewis determined to examine more
minutely the lower part of the bay, and, embarking
in one of the large canoes, was put on
shore at the point, whence he proceeded by
land with four men, and the canoe returned
nearly filled with water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 15.</i> It continued raining all
night, but in the morning the weather became
calm and fair. We began, therefore, to prepare
for setting out; but before we were ready a high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
wind sprang up from the southeast, and obliged
us to remain. The sun shone until one o'clock,
and we were thus enabled to dry our bedding and
examine our baggage. The rain, which had continued
for the last ten days without any interval
of more than two hours, had completely wet all
our merchandise, spoiled some of our fish, destroyed
the robes, and rotted nearly one-half of
our few remaining articles of clothing, particularly
the leather dresses. About three o'clock
the wind fell, and we instantly loaded the canoes,
and left the miserable spot to which we had been
confined the last six days. On turning the
point we came to the sand beach, through which
runs a small stream from the hills, at the mouth
of which was an ancient village of thirty-six
houses, without any inhabitants at the time except
fleas. Here we met Shannon, who had been
sent back to us by Captain Lewis. The day
Shannon left us in the canoe, he and Willard proceeded
on till they met a party of twenty Indians,
who, not having heard of us, did not know who
they were; but they behaved with great civility&mdash;so
great, indeed, and seemed so anxious that
our men should accompany them towards the
sea, that their suspicions were aroused, and they
declined going. The Indians, however, would
not leave them; and the men, becoming confirmed
in their suspicions, and fearful, if they
went into the woods to sleep, that they would
be cut to pieces in the night, thought it best to
remain with the Indians: they therefore made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
a fire, and after talking with them to a late hour,
laid down with their rifles under their heads.
When they awoke they found that the Indians
had stolen and concealed their arms; and having
demanded them in vain, Shannon seized a club,
and was about assaulting one of the Indians
whom he suspected to be the thief, when another
of them began to load his fowling-piece with the
intention of shooting him. He therefore stopped,
and explained to them by signs, that if they
did not give up the guns, a large party would
come down the river before the sun rose to a certain
height, and put every one of them to death.
Fortunately, Captain Lewis and his party appeared
at this very time, and the terrified Indians
immediately brought the guns, and five of them
came in with Shannon. To these men we declared
that, if ever any of their nation stole anything
from us, he would be instantly shot. They
resided to the north of this place, and spoke a
language different from that of the people higher
up the river. It was now apparent that the
sea was at all times too rough for us to proceed
farther down the bay by water: we therefore
landed, and, having chosen the best spot we
could, made our camp of boards from the old
village. We were now comfortably situated;
and, being visited by four Wahkiacums with
<i>wappatoo</i> roots, were enabled to make an agreeable
addition to our food.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 16.</i> The morning was clear and
pleasant. We therefore put out all our baggage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to dry, and sent several of our party to hunt.
Our camp was in full view of the ocean, on the
bay laid down by Vancouver, which we distinguished
by the name of Haley's Bay, from a
trader who visits the Indians here, and is a great
favourite among them. The meridian altitude
of this day gave 46&deg; 19&acute; 11.7&rdquo; as our latitude.
The wind was strong from the southwest, and
the waves were very high, yet the Indians were
passing up and down the bay in canoes, and
several of them encamped near us. We smoked
with them, but, after our recent experience of
their thievish disposition, treated them with
caution....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hunters brought in two deer, a crane,
some geese and ducks, and several brant, three
of which were white, except a part of the wing,
which was black, and they were much larger than
the gray brant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 17.</i> A fair, cool morning, and
easterly wind. The tide rises at this place eight
feet six inches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About one o'clock Captain Lewis returned,
after having coasted down Haley's Bay to Cape
Disappointment, and some distance to the north,
along the seacoast. He was followed by several
Chinnooks, among whom were the principal chief
and his family. They made us a present of a
boiled root very much like the common licorice
in taste and size, called <i>culwhamo</i>; and in return
we gave them articles of double its value. We
now learned, however, the danger of accepting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
anything from them, since nothing given in payment,
even though ten times more valuable,
would satisfy them. We were chiefly occupied
in hunting, and were able to procure three deer,
four brant, and two ducks; and also saw some
signs of elk. Captain Clarke now prepared for
an excursion down the bay, and accordingly
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 18</i>, at daylight, accompanied by
eleven men, he proceeded along the beach
one mile to a point of rocks about forty feet
high, where the hills retired, leaving a wide beach
and a number of ponds covered with water-fowl,
between which and the mountain there was a
narrow bottom covered with alder and small balsam
trees. Seven miles from the rocks was the
entrance from the creek, or rather drain from the
pond and hills, where was a cabin of Chinnooks.
The cabin contained some children and four
women. They were taken across the creek in a
canoe by two squaws, to each of whom they gave
a fish-hook, and then, coasting along the bay,
passed at two miles the low bluff of a small hill,
below which were, the ruins of some old huts, and
close to it the remains of a whale. The country
was low, open, and marshy, interspersed with
some high pine and with a thick undergrowth.
Five miles from the creek, they came to a stream,
forty yards wide at low water, which they called
Chinnook River. The hills up this river and
towards the bay were not high, but very thickly
covered with large pine of several species.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Proceeding along the shore, they came to a
deep bend, appearing to afford a good harbour,
and here the natives told them that European
vessels usually anchored. About two miles
farther on they reached Cape Disappointment,
&ldquo;an elevated circular knob,&rdquo; says the Journal,
&ldquo;rising with a steep ascent one hundred and fifty
or one hundred and sixty feet above the water,
formed like the whole shore of the bay, as well
as of the seacoast, and covered with thick timber
on the inner side, but open and grassy on the exposure
next the sea. From this cape a high
point of land bears south 20&deg; west, about twenty-five
miles distant. In the range between these
two eminences is the opposite point of the bay,
a very low ground, which has been variously
called Cape Rond by Le Perouse, and Point
Adams by Vancouver. The water, for a great
distance off the mouth of the river, appears very
shallow, and within the mouth, nearest to Point
Adams, is a large sand-bar, almost covered at
high tide....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 19.</i> In the evening it began to
rain, and continued until eleven o'clock. Two
hunters were sent out in the morning to kill something
for breakfast, and the rest of the party,
after drying their blankets, soon followed. At
three miles they overtook the hunters, and breakfasted
on a small deer which they had been fortunate
enough to kill. This, like all those that we
saw on the coast, was much darker than our common
deer. Their bodies, too, are deeper, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
legs shorter, and their eyes larger. The branches
of the horns are similar, but the upper part of the
tail is black, from the root to the end, and they
do not leap, but jump like a sheep frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuing along five miles farther, they
reached a point of high land, below which a sandy
point extended in a direction north 19&deg; west to
another high point twenty miles distant. To this
they gave the name of Point Lewis. They proceeded
four miles farther along the sandy beach
to a small pine tree, on which Captain Clarke
marked his name, with the year and day, and
then set out to return to the camp, where they
arrived the following day, having met a large
party of Chinnooks coming from it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>November 21.</i> The morning was cloudy,
and from noon till night it rained. The wind,
too, was high from the southeast, and the sea so
rough that the water reached our camp. Most
of the Chinnooks returned home, but we were
visited in the course of the day by people of
different bands in the neighbourhood, among
whom were the Chiltz, a nation residing on
the seacoast near Point Lewis, and the Clatsops,
who live immediately opposite, on the south
side of the Columbia. A chief from the grand
rapid also came to see us, and we gave him a
medal. To each of our visitors we made a present
of a small piece of riband, and purchased
some cranberries, and some articles of their
manufacture, such as mats and household furniture,
for all of which we paid high prices.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>January 1, 1806.</i> Passed six very elegant
bark canoes on the bank of the river, which had
been laid up by the Chipeways; also a camp
which we had conceived to have been evacuated
about ten days. My interpreter came after me
in a great hurry, conjuring me not to go so far
ahead, and assured me that the Chipeways,
encountering me without an interpreter, party, or
flag, would certainly kill me. But, notwithstanding
this, I went on several miles farther
than usual, in order to make any discoveries
that were to be made; conceiving the savages
not so barbarous or ferocious as to fire on two
men (I had one with me) who were apparently
coming into their country, trusting to their
generosity; and knowing, that if we met only
two or three we were equal to them, I having my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
gun and pistols and he his buckshot. Made
some extra presents for New Year's day.</p>

<p><i>January 2.</i> Fine, warm day. Discovered
fresh signs of Indians. Just as we were encamping
at night, my sentinel informed us that some
Indians were coming at full speed upon our trail
or track. I ordered my men to stand by their
guns carefully. They were immediately at my
camp, and saluted the flag by a discharge of three
pieces, when four Chipeways, one Englishman,
and a Frenchman of the North West Company
presented themselves. They informed us that
some women having discovered our trail gave
the alarm, and not knowing but it was their
enemies had departed to make a discovery.
They had heard of us, and revered our flag. Mr.
Grant, the Englishman, had only arrived the
day before from Lake de Sable, from which he
marched in one day and a half. I presented
the Indians with half a deer, which they received
thankfully, for they had discovered our fires
some days ago, and believing them to be Sioux
fires, they dared not leave their camp. They
returned home, but Mr. Grant remained all
night.</p>

<p><i>January 3.</i> My party marched early, but I
returned with Mr. Grant to his establishment on
the Red Cedar Lake, having one corporal with
me. ... After explaining to a Chipeway
warrior, called Curly Head, the object of my
voyage, and receiving his answer that he would
remain tranquil until my return, we ate a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
breakfast for the country, departed and overtook
my sleds just at dusk. Killed one porcupine.
Distance sixteen miles.</p>

<p><i>January 4.</i> We made twenty-eight points
in the river; broad, good bottom, and of the usual
timber. In the night I was awakened by the
cry of the sentinel, calling repeatedly to the men;
at length he vociferated, &ldquo;Will you let the lieutenant
be burned to death?&rdquo; This immediately
aroused me; at first I seized my arms, but looking
round, I saw my tents in flames. The men flew
to my assistance, and we tore them down, but
not until they were entirely ruined. This, with
the loss of my leggins, moccasins, and socks,
which I had hung up to dry, was no trivial misfortune
in such a country and on such a voyage.
But I had reason to thank God that the powder,
three small casks of which I had in my tent, did
not take fire; if it had, I must certainly have lost
all my baggage, if not my life.</p>

<p><i>January 5.</i> Mr. Grant promised to overtake
me yesterday, but has not yet arrived. I conceived
it would be necessary to attend his motions
with careful observation. Distance twenty-seven
miles.</p>

<p><i>January 6.</i> Bradley and myself walked up
thirty-one points in hopes to discover Lake de
Sable; but finding a near cut of twenty yards for
ten miles, and being fearful the sleds would miss
it, we returned twenty-three points before we
found our camp. They had made only eight
points. Met two Frenchmen of the North West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Company with about one hundred and eighty
pounds on each of their backs, with rackets [snowshoes]
on; they informed me that Mr. Grant had
gone on with the Frenchmen. Snow fell all day,
and was three feet deep. Spent a miserable
night.</p>

<p><i>January 7.</i> Made but eleven miles, and was
then obliged to send ahead and make fires every
three miles; notwithstanding which, the cold was
so intense that some of the men had their noses,
others their fingers, and others their toes, frozen,
before they felt the cold sensibly. Very severe
day's march.</p>

<p><i>January 8.</i> Conceiving I was at no great
distance from Sandy Lake, I left my sleds and
with Corporal Bradley took my departure for
that place, intending to send him back the same
evening. We walked on very briskly until
near night, when we met a young Indian, one of
those who had visited my camp near Red Cedar
Lake. I endeavoured to explain to him that it
was my wish to go to Lake de Sable that evening.
He returned with me until we came to a trail
that led across the woods; this he signified was
a near course. I went this course with him, and
shortly after found myself at a Chipeway encampment,
to which I believed the friendly savage
had enticed me with the expectation that I would
tarry all night, knowing that it was too late for
us to make the lake in good season. But upon
our refusing to stay, he put us in the right road.
We arrived at the place where the track left the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Mississippi at dusk, when we traversed about
two leagues of a wilderness without any very
great difficulty, and at length struck the shore
of Lake de Sable, over a branch of which lay our
course. The snow having covered the trail made
by the Frenchmen who had passed before us with
the rackets, I was fearful of losing ourselves on
the lake; the consequences of which can only be
conceived by those who have been exposed on a
lake or naked plain, in a dreary night of January,
in latitude 47&deg;, and the thermometer below zero.
Thinking that we could observe the bank of the
other shore, we kept a straight course, and some
time after discovered lights, and on our arrival
were not a little surprised to find a large stockade.
The gate being open, we entered and proceeded
to the quarters of Mr. Grant, where we were
treated with the utmost hospitality.</p>

<p><i>January 9.</i> Sent away the corporal early,
in order that our men should receive assurances
of our safety and success. He carried with him,
a small keg of spirits, a present from Mr. Grant.
The establishment of this place was formed
twelve years since by the North West Company,
and was formerly under the charge of Mr. Charles
Brusky. It has attained at present such regularity
as to permit the superintendent to live
tolerably comfortably. They have horses they
procure from Red River from the Indians; they
raise plenty of potatoes, catch pike, suckers,
pickerel, and white fish in abundance. They
have also beaver, deer, and moose; but the provision<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
they chiefly depend upon is wild oats, of
which they purchase great quantities from the
savages, giving at the rate of about one dollar
and a half a bushel. But flour, pork, and salt are
almost interdicted to persons not principals in
the trade. Flour sells at half a dollar, salt at a
dollar, pork at eighty cents, sugar at fifty cents,
and tea at four dollars and a half a pound. The
sugar is obtained from the Indians, and is made
from the maple tree.</p>

<p><i>January 10.</i> Mr. Grant accompanied me to
the Mississippi, to mark the place for my boats
to leave the river. This was the first time I
marched on rackets [snowshoes]. I took the
course of the Lake River, from its mouth to the
lake. Mr. Grant fell through the ice with his
rackets on, and could not have got out without
assistance.</p>

<p><i>January 11.</i> Remained all day within quarters.</p>

<p><i>January 12.</i> Went out and met my men
about sixteen miles. A tree had fallen on one of
them and hurt him very much, which induced me
to dismiss a sled and put the loading on the
others.</p>

<p><i>January 13.</i> After encountering much difficulty
we arrived at the establishment of the
North West Company on Lake de Sable a little
before night. The ice being very bad on the
Lake River, owing to the many springs and
marshes, one sled fell through. My men had an
excellent room furnished them, and were presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
with potatoes and spirits. Mr. Grant
had gone to an Indian lodge to receive his credits.</p>

<p><i>January 14.</i> Crossed the lake to the north
side, that I might take an observation; found the
latitude 46&deg; 9&acute; 20&rdquo; N. Surveyed that part of
the lake. Mr. Grant returned from the Indian
lodges. His party brought a quantity of furs
and eleven beaver carcasses.</p>

<p><i>January 15.</i> Mr. Grant and myself made
the tour of the lake with two men whom I had
for attendants. Found it to be much larger
than could be imagined at a view. My men
sawed stocks for the sleds, which I found it
necessary to construct after the manner of the
country. On our march, met an Indian coming
into the fort; his countenance expressed no little
astonishment when I told him who I was and
whence I came, for the people of this country
acknowledge that the savages hold the Americans
in greater veneration than any other white
people. They say of us, when alluding to warlike
achievements, that &ldquo;we are neither Frenchmen
nor Englishmen, but white Indians.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>January 16.</i> Laid down Lake de Sable.
A young Indian whom I had engaged to go as a
guide to Lake Sang Sue arrived from the woods.</p>

<p><i>January 17.</i> Employed in making sleds
after the manner of the country. They are made
of a single plank turned up at one end like a
fiddle head, and the baggage is lashed on in bags
and sacks. Two other Indians arrived from the
woods. Engaged in writing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>January 18.</i> Busy in preparing my baggage
for my departure for Leech Lake and Reading.</p>

<p><i>January 19.</i> Employed as yesterday. Two
men of the North West Company arrived from
the Fond du Lac Superior with letters; one of
which was from their establishment in Athapuscow,
and had been since last May on the route.
While at this post I ate roasted beavers, dressed
in every respect as a pig is usually dressed with
us; it was excellent. I could not discern the
least taste of Des Bois. I also ate boiled moose's
head, which when well boiled I consider equal
to the tail of the beaver; in taste and substance
they are much alike.</p>

<p><i>January 20.</i> The men, with their sleds,
took their departure about two o'clock. Shortly
after I followed them. We encamped at the
portage between the Mississippi and Leech Lake
River. Snow fell in the night.</p>

<p><i>January 21.</i> Snowed in the morning, but
crossed about 9 o'clock. I had gone on a few
points when I was overtaken by Mr. Grant, who
informed me that the sleds could not get along
in consequence of water being on the ice; he sent
his men forward; we returned and met the sleds,
which had scarcely advanced one mile. We unloaded
them, sent eight men back to the post,
with whatever might be denominated extra
articles, but in the hurry sent my salt and ink.
Mr. Grant encamped with me and marched early
in the morning.</p>

<p><i>January 22.</i> Made a pretty good day's journey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
My Indian came up about noon. Distance
twenty miles.</p>

<p><i>January 23.</i> Marched about eighteen miles.
Forgot my thermometer, having hung it on a
tree. Sent Boley back five miles for it. My
young Indian and myself killed eight partridges;
took him to live with me.</p>

<p><i>January 24.</i> At our encampment this night
Mr. Grant had encamped on the night of the same
day he left me; it was three days' march for us.
It was late before the men came up.</p>

<p><i>January 25.</i> Travelled almost all day
through the lands and found them much better
than usual. Boley lost the Sioux pipe-stem
which I had carried along for the purpose of
making peace with the Chipeways; I sent him
back for it; he did not return until eleven o'clock
at night. It was very warm; thawing all day.
Distance forty-four points.</p>

<p><i>January 26.</i> I left my party in order to
proceed to a house, or lodge, of Mr. Grant's on the
Mississippi, where he was to tarry until I overtook
him. Took with me an Indian, Boley,
and some trifling provision; the Indian and myself
marched so fast that we left Boley on the
route, about eight miles from the lodge. Met
Mr. Grant's men, on their return to Lake de
Sable, having evacuated the house this morning,
and Mr. Grant having marched for Leech Lake.
The Indian and I arrived before sundown.
Passed the night very uncomfortably, having
nothing to eat, not much wood, nor any blankets.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
The Indian slept sound. I cursed his insensibility,
being obliged to content myself over a
few coals all night. Boley did not arrive. In
the night the Indian mentioned something about
his son.</p>

<p><i>January 27.</i> My Indian rose early, mended
his moccasins, then expressed by signs something
about his son and the Englishmen we met
yesterday. Conceiving that he wished to send
some message to his family, I suffered him to
depart. After his departure I felt the curse of
solitude, although he was truly no company.
Boley arrived about ten o'clock. He said that
he had followed us until some time in the night,
when, believing that he could overtake us, he
stopped and made a fire, but having no axe to
cut wood he was near freezing. He met the
Indians, who made him signs to go on. I spent
the day in putting my gun in order, and mended
my moccasins. Provided plenty of wood, still
found it cold, with but one blanket.</p>

<p><i>January 28.</i> Left our encampment at a
good hour; unable to find any trail, passed
through one of the most dismal cypress swamps
I ever saw and struck the Mississippi at a small
lake. Observed Mr. Grant's tracks going through
it; found his mark of a cut-off (agreed on between
us); took it, and proceeded very well until we
came to a small lake, where the trail was entirely
hid, but after some search on the other side,
found it, when we passed through a dismal
swamp, on the other side of which we found a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
large lake, at which I was entirely at a loss, no
trail to be seen. Struck for a point about three
miles off, where we found a Chipeway lodge of
one man and five children, and one old woman.
They received us with every mark that distinguished
their barbarity, such as setting their
dogs on us, trying to thrust their hands into our
pockets, and so on, but we convinced them that
we were not afraid, and let them know that we
were Chewockomen (Americans), when they
used us more civilly. After we had arranged a
camp as well as possible I went into the lodge;
they presented me with a plate of dried meat.
I ordered Miller to bring about two gills of liquor,
which made us all good friends. The old squaw
gave me more meat, and offered me tobacco,
which, not using, I did not take. I gave her an
order upon my corporal for one knife and half a
carrot of tobacco. Heaven clothes the lilies
and feeds the raven, and the same Almighty
Providence protects and preserves these creatures.
After I had gone out to my fire, the old
man came out and proposed to trade beaver
skins for whiskey; meeting with a refusal he left
me; when presently the old woman came out
with a beaver skin, she also being refused, he
again returned to the charge with a quantity of
dried meat (this or any other I should have been
glad to have had) when I gave him a peremptory
refusal; then all further application ceased. It
really appeared that with one quart of whiskey
I might have bought all they were possessed of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Night remarkably cold, was obliged to sit up
nearly the whole of it. Suffered much with
cold and from want of sleep.</p>

<p><i>January 31.</i> Took my clothes into the Indian's
lodge to dress, and was received very
coolly, but by giving him a dram (unasked),
and his wife a little salt, I received from them
directions for my route. Passed the lake or
morass, and opened on meadows (through
which the Mississippi winds its course) of nearly
fifteen miles in length. Took a straight course
through them to the head, when I found we
had missed the river; made a turn of about two
miles and regained it. Passed a fork which I
supposed to be Lake Winipie, making the
course northwest; the branch we took was on
Leech Lake branch, course southwest and
west. Passed a very large meadow or prairie,
course west, the Mississippi only fifteen yards
wide. Encamped about one mile below the
traverse of the meadow. Saw a very large animal,
which from its leaps I supposed to be a
panther; but if so, it was twice as large as those
on the lower Mississippi. He evinced some disposition
to approach. I lay down (Miller being
in the rear) in order to entice him to come near,
but he would not. The night remarkably cold.
Some spirits, which I had in a small keg, congealed
to the consistency of honey.</p>

<p><i>February 1.</i> Left our camp pretty early.
Passed a continuous train of prairie, and arrived
at Lake Sang Sue at half-past two o'clock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
I will not attempt to describe my feelings on
the accomplishment of my voyage, for this is
the main source of the Mississippi. The Lake
Winipie branch is navigable from thence to
Red Cedar Lake for the distance of five leagues,
which is the extremity of the navigation. Crossed
the lake twelve miles to the establishment of
the North West Company, where we arrived
about three o'clock; found all the gates locked,
but upon knocking were admitted and received
with marked attention and hospitality by Mr.
Hugh McGillis. Had a good dish of coffee,
biscuit, butter and cheese for supper.</p>

<p><i>February 2.</i> Remained all day within doors.
In the evening sent an invitation to Mr. Anderson,
who was an agent of Dickson, and also for
some young Indians at his house, to come over
and breakfast in the morning.</p>

<p><i>February 3.</i> Spent the day in reading
Volney's &ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; proposing some queries to
Mr. Anderson, and preparing my young men to
return with a supply of provisions to my party.</p>

<p><i>February 4.</i> Miller departed this morning.
Mr. Anderson returned to his quarters. My
legs and ankles were so much swelled that I
was not able to wear my own clothes, and was
obliged to borrow some from Mr. McGillis.</p>

<p><i>February 5.</i> One of Mr. McGillis's clerks
had been sent to some Indian lodges, and expected
to return in four days, but had now
been absent nine. Mr. Grant was despatched,
in order to find out what had become of him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><i>February 6.</i> My men arrived at the fort
about four o'clock. Mr. McGillis asked if I had
any objection to his hoisting their flag in compliment
to ours. I made none, as I had not
yet explained to him my ideas. In making a
traverse of the lake some of my men had their
ears, some their noses, and others their chins
frozen.</p>

<p><i>February 7.</i> Remained within doors, my
limbs being still very much swelled. Addressed
a letter to Mr. McGillis on the subject of the
North West Company's trade in this quarter.</p>

<p><i>February 8.</i> Took the latitude and found
it to be 47&deg; 16&acute; 13". Shot with our rifles.</p>

<p><i>February 9.</i> M. McGillis and myself paid
a visit to Mr. Anderson, an agent of Mr. Dickson,
of the lower Mississippi, who resided at the
west end of the lake. Found him eligibly situated
as to trade, but his houses bad. I rode in
a cariole, for one person, constructed in the
following manner: Boards planed smooth,
turned up in front about two feet, coming to a
point; about two and a half feet wide behind,
on which is fixed a box covered with dressed
skins painted; this box is open at the top, but
covered in front about two-thirds of the length.
The horse is fastened between the shafts. The
rider wraps himself up in a buffalo robe, sits
flat down, having a cushion to lean his back
against. Thus accoutred with a fur cap, and
so on, he may bid defiance to the wind and
weather. Upon our return we found that some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of the Indians had already returned from the
hunting camps; also Monsieur Roussand, the
gentleman supposed to have been killed by
the Indians. His arrival with Mr. Grant diffused
a general satisfaction through the fort.</p>

<p><i>February 10.</i> Hoisted the American flag
in the fort. Reading &ldquo;Shenstone,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p><i>February 11.</i> The Sweet, Buck, Burnt,
and others arrived, all chiefs of note, but the
former in particular, a venerable old man.
From him I learned that the Sioux occupied
this ground when, to use his own phrase, &ldquo;He
was made a man and began to hunt; that they
occupied it the year that the French missionaries
were killed at the river Pacagama.&rdquo; The
Indians flocked in.</p>

<p><i>February 12.</i> Bradley and myself with
Mr. McGillis' and two of his men left Leech
Lake at 10 o'clock, and arrived at the house of
Red Cedar Lake at sunset, a distance of thirty
miles. My ankles were very much swelled,
and I was very lame. From the entrance of the
Mississippi to the strait is called six miles, a
southwest course. Thence to the south end,
south thirty, east four miles. The bay at the
entrance extends nearly east and west six miles.
About two and a half from the north side to
a large point. This, may be called the upper
source of the Mississippi, being fifteen miles
above little Lake Winipie, and the extent of
canoe navigation only two leagues to some of
the Hudson's Bay waters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Charles Wilkes</span></h3>

<div class="noteb"><p>[During 1838-42 Lieutenant Wilkes commanded an exploring
expedition which was the first ever despatched for scientific
research by the United States. The instructions given
by Congress to the Commander said:&mdash;&ldquo;The expedition is
not for conquest, but discovery. Its objects are all peaceful;
they are to extend the empire of commerce and science; to
diminish the hazards of the ocean, and point out to future
navigators a course by which they may avoid dangers and
find safety.&rdquo; The narrative of the expedition was published
in five volumes in Philadelphia, 1845. The extracts
which follow are from Vol. V., chapter VIII. From 1844
to 1874 the Government of the United States published
twenty-eight volumes reciting in detail the scientific results
of the expedition.]</p></div>


<p>At daylight, on the 13th of January, 1842,
we were again under way, with a light air, and
at nine o'clock reached the roadstead, where
we anchored in six fathoms of water, with good
holding ground.</p>

<p>A number of vessels were lying in the roads,
among which were several Americans loading
with hemp. There was also a large English
East Indiaman, manned by Lascars, whose noise
rendered her more like a floating Bedlam than
anything else to which I can liken it.</p>

<p>The view of the city and country around
Manila partakes both of a Spanish and an Oriental
character. The sombre and heavy-looking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
churches with their awkward towers; the long
lines of batteries mounted with heavy cannon;
the massive houses, with ranges of balconies;
and the light and airy cottages, elevated on posts,
situated in the luxuriant groves of tropical trees,&mdash;all
excite desire to become better acquainted
with the country.</p>

<p>Manila is situated on an extensive plain,
gradually swelling into distant hills, beyond
which, again, mountains rise in the background,
to the height of several thousand feet. The
latter are apparently clothed with vegetation
to their summits. The city is in strong contrast
to this luxuriant scenery, bearing evident marks
of decay, particularly in the churches, whose
steeples and tile roofs have a dilapidated look.
The site of the city does not appear to have
been well chosen, it having apparently been
selected entirely for the convenience of commerce,
and the communication that the outlet
of the lake affords for the batteaux [freight
boats] that transport the produce from the
shores of the Laguna de Bay to the city.</p>

<p>There are many arms or branches to this
stream, which have been converted into canals;
and almost any part of Manila may now be
reached in a banca [small passage boat].</p>

<p>The canal is generally filled with coasting
vessels, batteaux from the lake, and lighters for
the discharge of the vessels lying in the roads.
The bay of Manila is safe, excepting during the
change of the monsoons, when it is subject to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the typhoons of the China seas, within whose
range it lies. These blow at times with much
force, and cause great damage. Foreign vessels
have, however, kept this anchorage, and rode
out these storms in safety; but native as well
as Spanish vessels seek at these times the port
of Cavite, about three leagues to the southwest,
at the entrance of the bay, which is perfectly
secure. Here the government dockyard is situated,
and this harbour is consequently the
resort of the few gunboats and galleys that are
stationed here.</p>

<p>The entrance to the canal or river Pasig is
three hundred feet wide, and is enclosed between
two well-constructed piers, which extend for
some distance into the bay. On the end of one
of these is the light-house, and on the other a
guard-house. The walls of these piers are about
four feet above ordinary high water, and include
the natural channel of the river, whose
current sets out with some force, particularly
when the ebb is making in the bay.</p>

<p>The suburbs, or Binondo quarter, contain
more inhabitants than the city itself, and is
the commercial town. They have all the stir
and life incident to a large population actively
engaged in trade, and in this respect the contrast
with the city proper is great.</p>

<p>The city of Manila is built in the form of a
large segment of a circle, having the chord of
the segment on the river: the whole is strongly
fortified with walls and ditches. The houses are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
substantially built after the fashion of the
mother country. Within the walls are the
governor's palace, custom-house, treasury, admiralty,
several churches, convents, and charitable
institutions, a university, and the barracks
for the troops; it also contain some public
squares, on one of which is a bronze statute of
Charles IV.</p>

<p>The city is properly deemed the court residence
of these islands; and all those attached
to the government, or who wish to be considered
as of the higher circle, reside here; but
foreigners are not permitted to do so. The
houses in the city are generally of stone, plastered,
and white or yellow washed on the outside.
They are only two stories high, and in consequence
cover a large space, being built around
a patio or courtyard.</p>

<p>The ground floors are occupied as storehouses,
stables, and for porters' lodges. The second story
is devoted to the dining halls and sleeping
apartments, kitchens, bath-rooms, etc. The
bed-rooms have the windows down to the floor,
opening on wide balconies, with blinds or shutters.
These blinds are constructed with sliding
frames, having small squares of two inches
filled in with a thin semi-transparent shell, a
species of Placuna; the fronts of some of the
houses have a large number of these small lights,
where the females of the family may enjoy
themselves unperceived.</p>

<p>After entering the canal, we very soon found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
ourselves among a motley and strange population.
On landing, the attention is drawn to
the vast number of small stalls and shops with
which the streets are lined on each side, and
to the crowds of people passing to and fro, all
intent upon their several occupations. The
artisans in Manila are almost wholly Chinese;
and all trades are local, so that in each
quarter of the Binondo suburb the privilege
of exclusive occupancy is claimed by some
particular kinds of shops. In passing up the
Escolta (which is the longest and main street
in this district), the cabinet-makers, seen busily
at work in their shops, are first met with;
next to these come the tinkers and blacksmiths;
then the shoemakers, clothiers, fishmongers,
haberdashers, etc. These are flanked by outdoor
occupations; and in each quarter are numerous
cooks frying cakes, stewing, etc., in movable
kitchens; while here and there are to be
seen betel-nut sellers, either moving about to
obtain customers, or taking a stand in some
great thoroughfare. The moving throng, composed
of carriers, waiters, messengers, etc.,
pass quietly and without any noise: they are
generally seen with the Chinese umbrella,
painted of many colours, screening themselves
from the sun. The whole population wear
slippers, and move along with a slip-shod gait.</p>

<p>The Chinese are apparently far more numerous
than the Malays, and the two races differ
as much in character as in appearance: one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
all activity, while the other is disposed to avoid
all exertion. They preserve their distinctive
character throughout, mixing but very little
with each other, and are removed as far as
possible in their civilities; the former, from
their industry and perseverance, have almost
monopolized all the lucrative employments
among the lower orders, excepting the selling
of fish and betel-nut, and articles manufactured
in the provinces....</p>

<p>Of all her foreign possessions, the Philippines
have cost Spain the least blood and labour.
The honour of their discovery belongs to Magalhaens,
whose name is associated with the straits
at the southern extremity of the American
continent, but which has no memorial in these
islands. Now that the glory which he gained
by being the first to penetrate from the Atlantic
to the Pacific has been in some measure obliterated
by the disuse of those straits by navigators,
it would seem due to his memory that
some spot among these islands should be set
apart to commemorate the name of him who
made them known to Europe. This would be
but common justice to the discoverer of a
region which has been a source of so much
honour and profit to the Spanish nation, who
opened the vast expanse of the Pacific to the fleets
of Europe, and who died fighting to secure the
benefits of his enterprise to his king and country.</p>

<p>Few portions of the globe seem to be so
much the seat of internal fires, or to exhibit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the effects of volcanic action so strongly as the
Philippines. During our visit, it was not known
that any of the volcanoes were in action; but
many of them were smoking, particularly that
in the district of Albay, called Isaroc. Its latest
eruption was in the year 1839; but this did little
damage compared with that of 1814, which
covered several villages, and the country for a
great distance around, with ashes. This mountain
is situated to the southeast of Manila one
hundred and fifty miles, and is said to be a
perfect cone, with a crater at its apex.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the islands are much
affected by earthquakes, although some have
occasionally occurred that have done damage
to the churches at Manila.</p>

<p>The coal found in the Philippines is deemed
of value; it has a strong resemblance to the
bituminous coal of our own country, possesses
a bright lustre, and appears very free from all
woody texture when fractured. It is found
associated with sandstone, which contains many
fossils. Lead and copper are reported as being
very abundant; gypsum and limestone occur
in some districts. From this it will be seen that
these islands have everything in the mineral
way to constitute them desirable possessions.</p>

<p>With such mineral resources and a soil capable
of producing the most varied vegetation
of the tropics, a liberal policy is all that the
country lacks. The products of the Philippine
Islands consist of sugar, coffee, hemp, indigo,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
rice, tortoise-shell, hides, ebony, saffron-wood,
sulphur, cotton, cordage, silk, pepper, cocoa,
wax, and many other articles. In their agricultural
operations the people are industrious,
although much labour is lost by the use of defective
implements. The plow, of a very simple
construction, has been adopted from the Chinese;
it has no coulter, the share is flat, and being
turned partly to one side, answers, in a certain
degree the purpose of a mould-board. This rude
implement is sufficient for the rich soils, where
the tillage depends chiefly upon the harrow,
in constructing which a thorny species of
bamboo is used. The harrow is formed of five
or six pieces of this material, on which the thorns
are left, firmly fastened together. It answers
its purpose well, and is seldom out of order.
A wrought-iron harrow, that was introduced
by the Jesuits, is used for clearing the ground
more effectually, and more particularly for the
purpose of extirpating a troublesome grass,
that is known by the name of cogon (a species
of Andropogon), of which it is very difficult
to rid the fields. The bolo or long-knife, a basket,
a hoe, complete the implements, and answer
all the purposes of our spades, etc.</p>

<p>The buffalo was used until within a few years
exclusively in their agricultural operations, and
they have lately taken to the use of the ox;
but horses are never used. The buffalo, from
the slowness of his motions, and his exceeding
restlessness under the heat of the climate, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
ill adapted to agricultural labour; but the natives
are very partial to them, notwithstanding they
occasion them much labour and trouble in
bathing them during the great heat. This is
absolutely necessary, or the animal becomes so
fretful as to be unfit for use. If it were not for
this, the buffalo would, notwithstanding his
slow pace, be most effective in agricultural
operations; he requires little food, and that of
the coarsest kind; his strength surpasses that of
the stoutest ox, and he is admirably adapted
for the rice or paddy fields. They are very docile
when used by the natives, and even children
can manage them; but it said they have a great
antipathy to the whites and all strangers. The
usual mode of guiding them is by a small cord
attached to the cartilage of the nose. The yoke
rests on the neck before the shoulders, and is
of simple construction. To this is attached
whatever it may be necessary to draw, either
by traces, shafts, or other fastenings. Frequently
these animals may be seen with large
bundles of bamboo lashed to them on each side.
Buffaloes are to be met with on the lake with
no more than their noses and eyes out of the
water, and are not visible until they are approached
within a few feet, when they cause
alarm to the passengers by raising their large
forms close to the boat. It is said that they
resort to the lake to feed on a favourite grass
that grows on its bottom in shallow water,
and which they dive for. Their flesh is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
eaten, except that of the young ones, for it is
tough and tasteless. The milk is nutritious,
and of a character between that of the goat and
cow.</p>

<p>Rice is, perhaps, of their agricultural products,
the article upon which the inhabitants
of the Philippine Islands most depend for food
and profit; of this they have several different
varieties, which the natives distinguish by their
size and the shape of the grain: the birnambang,
lamuyo, malagequit, bontot-cabayo, dumali,
quinanda, bolohan, and tangi. The three first
are aquatic, the five latter upland varieties.
They each have their peculiar uses. The dumali
is the early variety; it ripens in three months
from planting, from which circumstance it
derives its name; it is raised exclusively on the
uplands. Although much esteemed, it is not
extensively cultivated, as the birds and insects
destroy a large part of the crop.</p>

<p>The malagequit is very much prized, and
used for making sweet and fancy dishes; it
becomes exceedingly glutinous, for which reason
it is used in making whitewash, which it is said
to cause to become of a brilliant white, and to
withstand the weather. This variety is not,
however, believed to be wholesome. There is
also a variety of this last species which is used
as food for horses, and supposed to be a remedy
and preventive against worms.</p>

<p>The rice grounds or fields are laid out in
squares, and surrounded by embankments, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
retain the water of the rains or streams. After
the rains have fallen in sufficient quantities to
saturate the ground, a seed-bed is generally
planted in one corner of the field, in which the
rice is sown broadcast, about the month of
June. The heavy rains take place in August,
when the fields are ploughed, and are soon filled
with water. The young plants are about this
time taken from the seed-bed, their tops and
roots trimmed, and then planted in the field
by making holes in the ground with the fingers
and placing four or five sprouts in each of them;
in this tedious labor the poor women are employed,
whilst the males are lounging in their
houses or in the shade of the trees.</p>

<p>The harvest for the aquatic rice begins in
December. It is reaped with small sickles,
peculiar to the country, called yatap; to the
back of these a small stick is fastened, by which
they are held, and the stalk is forced upon it
and cut. The spikes of rice are cut with this
implement, one by one. In this operation, men,
women and children, all take part.</p>

<p>The upland rice requires much more care and
labour in its cultivation. The land must be
ploughed three or four times, and all the turf and
lumps well broken up by the harrow.</p>

<p>During its growth it requires to be weeded
two or three times, to keep the weeds from choking
the crop. The seed is sown broadcast in
May. This kind of rice is harvested in November,
and to collect the crop is still more tedious than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in the other case, for it is always gathered earlier
and never reaped, in consequence of the grain
not adhering to the ear. If it were gathered
in any other way, the loss by transportation
on the backs of buffaloes and horses, without
any covering to the sheaf, would be so great
as to dissipate a great portion of the crop.</p>

<p>After the rice is harvested, there are different
modes of treating it. Some of the proprietors
take it home, where it is thrown into heaps,
and left until it is desirable to separate it from
the straw, when it is trodden out by men and
women with their bare feet. For this operation
they usually receive a fifth part of the
rice.</p>

<p>Others stack it in a wet and green state,
which subjects it to heat, from which cause
the grain contracts a dark colour and an unpleasant
taste and smell. The natives, however,
impute these defects to the wetness of the
season.</p>

<p>The crop of both the low and upland rice is
usually from thirty to fifty for one: this on old
land; but on that which is newly cleared, or
which has never been cultivated, the yield is
far beyond this. In some soils of the latter
description, it is said that for a chupa (seven
cubic inches) planted the yield has been a
caban. The former is the two-hundred-and-eighth
part of the latter. This is not the only
advantage gained in planting rice lands, but
the saving of labour is equally great; for all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
that is required is to make a hole with the fingers
and place three or four grains in it. The upland
rice requires but little water, and is never irrigated.</p>

<p>The cultivator in the Philippine Islands is
always enabled to secure plenty of manure;
for vegetation is so luxuriant that by pulling
the weeds and laying them with earth a good
stock is quickly obtained with which to cover
his fields. Thus, although the growth is so
rank as to cause him labour, yet in this hot
climate its decay is equally rapid, which tends
to make his labours more successful.</p>

<p>Among the important productions of these
islands, I have mentioned hemp, although the
article called Manila hemp must not be understood
to be derived from the plant which produces
the common hemp (<i>Canabis</i>), being obtained
from a species of plantain (<i>Musa textilis</i>),
called in the Philippines &ldquo;abaca.&rdquo; This is a
native of these islands, and was formerly believed
to be found only on Mindanao; but this
is not the case, for it is cultivated on the south
part of Luzon and all the islands south of it.
It grows on high ground, in rich soil, and is
propagated by seeds. It resembles the other
plants of the tribe of plantains, but its fruit is
much smaller, although edible. The fibre is
derived from the stem, and the plant attains
the height of fifteen or twenty feet. The usual
mode of preparing the hemp is to cut off the
stem near the ground, before the time or just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
when the fruit is ripe. The stem is then eight
or ten feet long below the leaves, where it is
again cut. The outer coating of the herbaceous
stem is then stripped off, until the fibres or
cellular parts are seen, when it undergoes the
process of rotting, and after being well dried
in houses and sheds, is prepared for market
by assorting it, a task which is performed by
the women and children. That which is intended
for cloth is soaked for an hour or two
in weak lime-water prepared from sea-shells,
again dried, and put up in bundles. From all
the districts in which it grows, it is sent to Manila,
which is the only port whence it can legally
be exported. It arrives in large bundles, and
is packed there by means of a screw-press in
compact bales, for shipping, secured by rattan,
each weighing two piculs. [A picul is about
140 pounds.]</p>

<p>The best Manila hemp ought to be white, dry,
and of a long and fine fibre. This is known at
Manila by the name of lupis; the second quality
they call bandala.</p>

<p>That which is brought to the United States
is principally manufactured in or near Boston,
and is the cordage known as &ldquo;white rope.&rdquo;
The cordage manufactured at Manila is, however,
very superior to the rope made with us,
although the hemp is of the inferior kind.
A large quantity is also manufactured into
mats.</p>

<p>In the opinion of our botanist, it is not probable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
that the plant could be introduced with
success into our country, for in the Philippines
it is not found north of latitude 14&deg; N.</p>

<p>The coffee-plant is well adapted to these
islands. A few plants were introduced into the
gardens of Manila about fifty years ago, since
which time it has been spread all over the island,
as is supposed, by the civet-cats, which, after
swallowing the seeds, carry them to a distance
before they are voided.</p>

<p>The coffee of commerce is obtained here from
the wild plant, and is of an excellent quality.
Upwards of three thousand five hundred piculs
are now exported, of which one-sixth goes to
the United States.</p>

<p>The sugar-cane thrives well here. It is planted
after the French fashion, by sticking the piece
diagonally into the ground. Some, finding the
cane has suffered in times of drought, have
adopted other modes. It comes to perfection
in a year, and they seldom have two crops
from the same piece of land, unless the season
is very favourable.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of cane cultivated,
but that grown in the valley of Pampanga is
thought to be the best. It is a small, red variety,
from four to five feet high, and not thicker than
the thumb. The manufacture of the sugar is
rudely conducted; and the whole business, I
was told, was in the hands of a few capitalists,
who, by making advances, secure the whole
crop from those who are employed to bring it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to market. It is generally brought in moulds of
the usual conical shape, called pilones, which are
delivered to the purchaser from November to
June, and contain each about one hundred and
fifty pounds. On their receipt they are placed
in large storehouses, where the familiar operation
of claying is performed. The estimate
for the quantity of sugar from these pilones
after this process is about one hundred
pounds; it depends upon the care taken in the
process.</p>

<p>Of cotton they raise a considerable quantity,
and principally of the yellow nankeen. In the
province of Ylocos it is cultivated most extensively.
The mode of cleaning it of its seed
is very rude, by means of a hand-mill, and the
expense of cleaning a picul (one hundred and
forty pounds) is from five to seven dollars.
There have, as far as I have understood, been
no endeavours to introduce any cotton-gins
from our country.</p>

<p>It will be merely necessary to give the prices
at which labourers are paid to show how the
compensation is in comparison with that in
our country. In the vicinity of Manila, twelve
and a half cents per day is the usual wages;
this in the provinces falls to six and nine cents.
A man with two buffaloes is paid about thirty
cents. The amount of labour performed by the
latter in a day would be the ploughing of a
soane, about two-tenths of an acre. The most
profitable way of employing labourers is by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
task, when, it is said, the natives work well,
and are industrious.</p>

<p>The manner in which the sugar and other
produce is brought to market at Manila is peculiar,
and deserves to be mentioned. In some
of the villages the chief men unite to build a
vessel, generally a pirogue, in which they embark
their produce, under the conduct of a
few persons, who go to navigate it, and dispose
of the cargo. In due time they make their
voyage, and when the accounts are settled,
the returns are distributed to each according
to his share. Festivities are then held, the
saints thanked for their kindness, and blessings
invoked for another year. After this is over, the
vessel is taken carefully to pieces, and distributed
among the owners, to be preserved for the
next season.</p>

<p>The profits in the crops, according to estimates,
vary from sixty to one hundred per cent.;
but it was thought, as a general average, that
this was, notwithstanding the great productiveness
of the soil, far beyond the usual profits
accruing from agricultural operations. In some
provinces this estimate would hold good, and
probably be exceeded.</p>

<p>Indigo would probably be a lucrative crop,
for that raised here is said to be of a quality
equal to the best, and the crop is not subject
to so many uncertainties as in India: the capital
and attention required in vats, etc., prevent it
from being raised in any quantities. Among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the productions, the bamboo and rattan ought
to claim a particular notice from their great
utility: they enter into almost everything. Of
the former their houses are built, including
frames, floors, sides, and roof; fences are made
of the same material, as well as every article
of general household use, including baskets for
oil and water. The rattan is a general substitute
for ropes of all descriptions, and the two combined
are used in constructing rafts for crossing
ferries.</p>

<p>The crops frequently suffer from the ravages
of the locusts, which sweep all before them.
Fortunately for the poorer classes, their attacks
take place after the rice has been harvested;
but the cane is sometimes entirely cut off.
The authorities of Manila, in the vain hope of
stopping their devastations, employ persons to
gather them and throw them into the sea. I
understood on one occasion they had spent
eighty thousand dollars in this way, but all to
little purpose. It is said that the crops rarely
suffer from droughts, but on the contrary the
rains are thought to fall too often and to flood
the rice fields; these, however, yield a novel
crop, and are very advantageous to the poor,
viz.: a great quantity of fish, which are called
dalag, and are a species of Blunnius; they are
so plentiful that they are caught with baskets;
these fish weigh from a half to two pounds, and
some are said to be eighteen inches long; but
this is not all; they are said, after a deep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
inundation, to be found even in the vaults of
churches.</p>

<p>The Philippines are divided into thirty-one
provinces, sixteen of which are on the island
of Luzon, and the remainder comprise the
other islands of the group and the Ladrones.</p>

<p>The population of the whole group is above
three millions, including all tribes of natives,
mestizoes, and whites. The latter-named class
are but few in number, not exceeding three
thousand. The mestizoes were supposed to be
about fifteen or twenty thousand; they are
distinguished as Spanish and Indian mestizoes.
The Chinese have of late years increased to a
large number, and it is said that there are forty
thousand of them in and around Manila alone.
One-half of the whole population belongs to
Luzon. The island next to it in number of inhabitants
is Panay, which contains about three
hundred and thirty thousand. Then come
Zebu, Mindanao, Leyte, Samar, and Negros,
varying from the above numbers down to fifty
thousand. The population is increasing, and
it is thought that it doubles itself in seventy
years. This rate of increase appears probable,
from a comparison of the present population
with the estimate made at the beginning of the
present century, which shows a growth in
forty years of about one million four hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>The native population is composed of a number
of distinct tribes, the principal of which in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Luzon are Pangarihan, Ylocos, Cagayan, Tagala,
and Pampangan.</p>

<p>The Irogotes, who dwell in the mountains,
are the only natives who have not been subjected
by the Spaniards. The other tribes have
become identified with their rulers in religion,
and it is thought that by this circumstance
alone has Spain been able to maintain the
ascendency, with so small a number, over such
a numerous, intelligent, and energetic race as
they are represented to be. This is, however,
more easily accounted for, from the Spaniards
fostering and keeping alive the jealousy and
hatred that existed at the time of the discovery
between the different tribes.</p>

<p>It seems almost incredible that Spain should
have so long persisted in the policy of allowing
no more than one galleon to pass annually
between her colonies, and equally so that the
nations of Europe should have been so long
deceived in regard to the riches and wealth
that Spain was monopolizing in the Philippines.
The capture of Manila, in 1762, by the English,
first gave a clear idea of the value of this remote
and little-known appendage of the empire.</p>

<p>The Philippines, considered in their capacity
for commerce, are certainly among the most
favoured portions of the globe, and there is
but one circumstance that tends in the least
degree to lessen their apparent advantage; this
is the prevalence of typhoons in the China
seas, which are occasionally felt with force to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
the north of latitude 10&deg; N. South of that
parallel they have never been known to prevail,
and seldom so far; but from their unfailing
occurrence yearly in some part of the China
seas, they are looked for with more or less dread,
and cause each season a temporary interruption
in all the trade that passes along the coast of
these islands.</p>

<p>The army is now composed entirely of native
troops, who number about six thousand men,
and the regiments are never suffered to serve
in the provinces in which they are recruited,
but those from the north are sent to the south,
and vice versa. There they are employed to
keep a continual watch on each other; and,
speaking different dialects, they never become
identified.</p>

<p>They are, indeed, never allowed to remain
long enough in one region to imbibe any feelings
in unison with those of its inhabitants.
The hostility is so great among the regiments
that mutinies have occurred, and contests
arisen which have produced even bloodshed,
which it was entirely out of the power of the
officers to prevent. In cases of this kind, summary
punishment is resorted to.</p>

<p>Although the Spaniards, as far as is known
abroad, live in peace and quiet, this is far from
being the case; for rebellion and revolts among
the troops and tribes are not unfrequent in
the provinces. During the time of our visit
one of these took place, but it was impossible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
to learn anything concerning it that could be
relied upon, for all conversation respecting
such occurrences is interdicted by the government.
The difficulty to which I refer was said
to have originated from the preaching of a
fanatic priest, who inflamed them to such a
degree that they overthrew the troops and
became temporarily masters of the country.
Prompt measures were immediately taken,
and orders issued to give the rebels no quarter;
the regiments most hostile to those in the revolt
were ordered to the spot; they spared no one;
the priest and his companions were taken,
put to death, and according to report, in a
manner so cruel as to be a disgrace to the records
of the nineteenth century. Although I should
hope the accounts I heard of these transactions
were incorrect, yet the detestation these acts
were held in would give some colour to the
statements.</p>

<p>The few gazettes that are published at Manila
are entirely under the control of the government;
and a resident of that city must make
up his mind to remain in ignorance of the things
that are passing around him, or believe just
what the authorities will allow to be told,
whether truth or falsehood. The government
of the Philippines is emphatically an iron rule;
how long can it continue so is doubtful.</p>

<p>The natives of the Philippines are industrious.
They manufacture an amount of goods sufficient
to supply their own wants, particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
from Panay and Ylocos. These, for the most
part, consist of cotton and silks, and a peculiar
article called pina. The latter is manufactured
from a species of Bromelia (pine-apple), and
comes principally from the island of Panay.
The finest kinds of pina are exceedingly beautiful
and surpass any other material in its evenness
and beauty of texture. Its colour is yellowish,
and the embroidery is fully equal to the material.
It is much sought after by all strangers, and
considered as one of the curiosities of this group.
Various reports have been stated of the
mode of its manufacture, and among others
that it was woven under water, which I found,
upon inquiry, to be quite erroneous. The web
of the pina is so fine that they are obliged to
prevent all currents of air from passing through
the rooms where it is manufactured, for which
purpose there are gauze screens in the windows.
After the article is brought to Manila, it is then
embroidered by girls; this last operation adds
greatly to its value.</p>

<p>The market is a never-failing place of amusement
to a foreigner; for there a crowd of the
common people is always to be seen, and their
mode of conducting business may be observed.
The canals here afford great facilities for bringing
vegetables and produce to market in a fresh
state. The vegetables are chiefly brought
from the shores of the Laguna de Bay, through
the river Pasig. The meat appeared inferior,
and as in all Spanish places the art of butchering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
is not understood. The poultry, however,
surpasses that of any other place I have seen,
particularly in ducks, the breeding of which is
pursued to a great extent. Establishments for
breeding these birds are here carried on in a
systematic manner, and are a great curiosity.
They consist of many small enclosures, each
about twenty feet by forty or fifty, made of
bamboo, which are placed on the bank of the
river, and partly covered with water. In one
corner of the enclosure is a small house, where
the eggs are hatched by artificial heat, produced
by rice-chaff in a state of fermentation. It is
not uncommon to see six or eight hundred
ducklings all of the same age. There are several
hundreds of these enclosures, and the number
of ducks of all ages may be computed at millions.
The manner in which they are schooled to take
exercise, and to go in and out of the water,
and to return to their house, almost exceeds
belief. The keepers or tenders are of the Tagala
tribe, who live near the enclosures, and have
them at all times under their eye. The old
birds are not suffered to approach the young,
and all of one age are kept together. They are
fed upon rice and a small species of shell-fish
that is found in the river and is peculiar to it.
From the extent of these establishments we
inferred that ducks were the favourite article
of food at Manila, and the consumption of them
must be immense. The markets are well supplied
with chickens, pigeons, young partridges, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
are brought in alive, and turkeys. Among
strange articles that we saw for sale were cakes
of coagulated blood. The markets are well
stocked with a variety of fish, taken both in the
Laguna and bay of Manila, affording a supply
of both the fresh and salt water species, and
many smaller kinds that are dried and smoked.
Vegetables are in great plenty, and consist of
pumpkins, lettuce, onions, radishes, very long
squashes, etc.; of fruits they have melons,
chicos, durians, marbolas, and oranges.</p>

<p>Fish are caught in weirs, by the hook, or in
seines. The former are constructed of bamboo
stakes, in the shallow water of the lake, at the
point where it flows through the river Pasig. In
the bay, and at the mouth of the river, the fish are
taken in nets, suspended by the four corners from
hoops attached to a crane, by which they are
lowered into the water. The fishing-boats are
little better than rafts, and are called saraboas.</p>

<p>The usual passage-boat is termed banca,
and is made of a single trunk. These are very
much used by the inhabitants. They have a
sort of awning to protect the passenger from
the rays of the sun; and being light are easily
rowed about, although they are exceedingly
uncomfortable to sit in, from the lowness of
the seats, and liable to overset if the weight is
not placed near the bottom. The out-rigger has
in all probability been dispensed with, owing
to the impediment it offered to the navigation
of their canals; these canals offer great facilities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
for the transportation of burdens; the banks of
almost all of them are faced with granite.
Where the streets cross them, there are substantial
stone bridges, which are generally of
no more than one arch, so as not to impede the
navigation. The barges used for the transportation
of produce resemble our canal-boats, and
have sliding roofs to protect them from the rain.</p>

<p>Water for the supply of vessels is brought
off in large earthen jars. It is obtained from the
river, and if care is not taken, the water will be
impure; it ought to be filled beyond the city.
Our supply was obtained five or six miles up
the river by a lighter, in which were placed
a number of water-casks. It proved excellent.</p>

<p>The country around Manila, though no more
than an extended plain for some miles, is one
of great interest and beauty, and affords many
agreeable rides on the roads to Santa Anna
and Maraquino. Most of the country-seats are
situated on the river Pasig; they may indeed
be called palaces, from their extent and appearance.
They are built upon a grand scale, and
after the Italian style, with terraces, supported
by strong abutments, decked with vases of
plants. The grounds are ornamented with the
luxuriant, lofty, and graceful trees of the tropics;
these are tolerably well kept. Here and there
fine large stone churches, with their towers and
steeples, are to be seen, the whole giving the
impression of a wealthy nobility and a happy
and flourishing peasantry.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clarence King.</span></h3>

<div class="noteb"><p>[In 1864 Professor Josiah Dwight Whitney, State Geologist
of California, sent a band of five explorers for a summer's
campaign in the high Sierras. Clarence King was assistant
geologist of the party; he recounted their researches and adventures
in &ldquo;Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada,&rdquo; published
in 1871 by J. R. Osgood &amp; Co., Boston; three years later
the same firm issued an enlarged edition with maps. &ldquo;The
Ascent of Mount Tyndall,&rdquo; the third chapter of the book,
is one of the most thrilling stories of adventure ever written.
Clarence King suggested and organized the United States
Geological Survey, and was its director 1878-81. He died
in 1901.]</p></div>


<p>Morning dawned brightly upon our bivouac
among a cluster of dark firs in the mountain corridor,
opened by an ancient glacier of King's
River in the heart of the Sierras. It dawned a
trifle sooner than we could have wished, but Professor
Brewer and Hoffman had breakfasted
before sunrise, and were off with barometer and
theodolite upon their shoulders, proposing to
ascend our amphitheatre to its head and climb a
great pyramidal peak which swelled up against
the eastern sky, closing the view in that direction.</p>

<p>We, who remained in camp, spent the day in
overhauling campaign materials and preparing
for a grand assault upon the summits. For a
couple of hours we could descry our friends
through the field-glasses, their minute black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
forms moving slowly on among piles of giant
d&eacute;bris; now and then lost, again coming into
view, and at last disappearing altogether.</p>

<p>It was twilight of evening and almost eight
o'clock when they came back to camp, Brewer
leading the way, Hoffman following; and as they
sat down by our fire without uttering a word we
read upon their faces terrible fatigue.</p>

<p>So we hastened to give them supper of coffee
and soup, bread and venison, which resulted,
after a time, in our getting in return the story
of the day.</p>

<p>For eight whole hours they had worked up
over granite and snow, mounting ridge after
ridge, till the summit was made about two
o'clock.</p>

<p>These snowy crests bounding our view at the
eastward we had all along taken to be the summits
of the Sierra, and Brewer had supposed himself
to be climbing a dominant peak, from which
he might look eastward over Owen's Valley and
out upon leagues of desert. Instead of this a
vast wall of mountains, lifted still higher than his
peak, rose beyond a tremendous ca&ntilde;on which lay
like a trough between the two parallel ranks of
peaks. Hoffman showed us on his sketch-book
the profile of this new range, and I instantly
recognized the peaks which I had seen from
Mariposa, whose great white pile had led me to
believe them the highest points of California.</p>

<p>For a couple of months my friends had made
me the target of plenty of pleasant banter about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
my &ldquo;highest land,&rdquo; which they lost faith in as
we climbed from Thomas's Mill,&mdash;I too becoming
a trifle anxious about it; but now the truth had
burst upon Brewer and Hoffman they could not
find words to describe the terribleness and grandeur
of the deep ca&ntilde;on, nor for picturing those
huge crags towering in line at the east. Their
peak, as indicated by the barometer, was in the
region of 13,400 feet, and a level across to the
farther range showed its crests to be at least
1,500 feet higher. They had spent hours upon
the summit scanning the eastern horizon, and
ranging downward into the labyrinth of gulfs
below, and had come at last with reluctance to
the belief that to cross this gorge and ascend the
eastern wall of peaks was utterly impossible.</p>

<p>Brewer and Hoffman were old climbers, and
their verdict of impossible opposed me as I
lay awake thinking about it; but early next
morning I had made up my mind, and, taking
Cotter aside, I asked him in an easy manner
whether he would like to penetrate the Unknown
Land with me at the risk of our necks, provided
Brewer should consent. In frank, courageous
tone he answered after his usual mode, &ldquo;Why
not?&rdquo; Stout of limb, stronger yet in heart, of
iron endurance, and a quiet, unexcited temperament,
and, better yet, deeply devoted to me, I
felt that Cotter was the one comrade I would
choose to face death with, for I believed
there was in his manhood no room for fear or
shirk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a trying moment for Brewer when we
found him and volunteered to attempt a campaign
for the top of California, because he felt a
certain fatherly responsibility over our youth,
a natural desire that we should not deposit our
triturated remains in some undiscoverable hole
among the feldspathic granites; but, like a true
disciple of science, this was at last overbalanced
by his intense desire to know more of the unexplored
region. He freely confessed that he
believed the plan madness, and Hoffman, too,
told us we might as well attempt to get on a
cloud as to try the peak.</p>

<p>As Brewer gradually yielded his consent, I
saw by his conversation that there was a possibility
of success; so we spent the rest of the day
in making preparations.</p>

<p>Our walking shoes were in excellent condition,
the hobnails firm and new. We laid out a barometer,
a compass, a pocket-level, a set of wet
and dry thermometers, note-books, with bread,
cooked beans, and venison enough to last a week,
rolled them all in blankets, making two knapsack-shaped
packs strapped firmly together with loops
for the arms, which, by Brewer's estimate,
weighed forty pounds apiece.</p>

<p>Gardner declared he would accompany us to
the summit of the first range to look over into
the gulf we were to cross, and at last Brewer and
Hoffman also concluded to go up with us.</p>

<p>Quite too early for our profit we all betook ourselves
to bed, vainly hoping to get a long refreshing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
sleep from which we should rise ready for our
tramp.</p>

<p>Never a man welcomed those first gray streaks
in the east gladder than I did, unless it may be
Cotter, who has in later years confessed that he
did not go to sleep that night. Long before sunrise
we had done our breakfast and were under
way, Hoffman kindly bearing my pack, and
Brewer Cotter's.</p>

<p>Our way led due east up the amphitheatre
and toward Mount Brewer, as we had named the
great pyramidal peak.</p>

<p>Awhile after leaving camp, slant sunlight
streamed in among gilded pinnacles along the
slope of Mount Brewer, touching here and there,
in broad dashes of yellow, the gray walls, which
rose sweeping up on either side like the sides of
a ship.</p>

<p>Our way along the valley's middle ascended
over a number of huge steps, rounded and abrupt,
at whose bases were pools of transparent snow-water
edged with rude piles of erratic glacier
blocks, scattered companies of alpine firs, of red
bark and having cypress-like darkness of foliage,
with fields of snow under sheltering cliffs, and
bits of softest velvet meadow clouded with
minute blue and white flowers.</p>

<p>As we climbed, the gorge grew narrow and
sharp, both sides wilder; and the spurs which
projected from them, nearly overhanging the
middle of the valley, towered above us with more
and more severe sculpture. We frequently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
crossed deep fields of snow, and at last reached
the level of the highest pines, where long slopes
of d&eacute;bris swept down from either cliff, meeting
in the middle. Over and among these immense
blocks, often twenty and thirty feet high, we
were obliged to climb, hearing far below us the
subterranean gurgle of streams.</p>

<p>Interlocking spurs nearly closed the gorge
behind us; our last view was out a granite gateway
formed of two nearly vertical precipices,
sharp-edged, jutting buttress-like, and plunging
down into a field of angular boulders which fill
the valley bottom.</p>

<p>The eye ranged out from this open gateway
overlooking the great King's Ca&ntilde;on with its
moraine-terraced walls, the domes of granite
upon Big Meadows, and the undulating stretch
of forest which descends to the plain.</p>

<p>The gorge turning southward, we rounded a
sort of mountain promontory, which, closing
the view behind us, shut us up in the bottom of
a perfect basin. In front lay a placid lake reflecting
the intense black-blue of the sky. Granite,
stained with purple and red, sank into it upon
one side, and a broad spotless field of snow came
down to its margin on the other.</p>

<p>From a pile of large granite blocks, forty or
fifty feet up above the lake margin, we could
look down fully a hundred feet through the transparent
water to where boulders and pebbles were
strewn upon the stone bottom. We had now
reached the base of Mount Brewer and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
skirting its southern spurs in a wide open corridor
surrounded in all directions by lofty granite
crags from two to four thousand feet high; above
the limits of vegetation, rocks, lakes of deep
heavenly blue, and white trackless snows were
grouped closely about us. Two sounds, a sharp
little cry of martens and occasional heavy
crashes of falling rock, saluted us.</p>

<p>Climbing became exceedingly difficult, light
air&mdash;for we had already reached 12,500 feet&mdash;beginning
to tell on our lungs to such an extent
that my friend, who had taken turns with me in
carrying my pack, was unable to do so any
longer, and I adjusted it to my own shoulders
for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>After four hours of slow laborious work we
made the base of the d&eacute;bris slope which rose
about a thousand feet to a saddle pass in the
western mountain wall, that range upon which
Mount Brewer is so prominent a point. We
were nearly an hour in toiling up this slope over
an uncertain footing which gave way at almost
every step. At last, when almost at the top,
we paused to take breath, and then all walked
out upon the crest, laid off our packs, and sat
down together upon the summit of the ridge, and
for a few minutes not a word was spoken.</p>

<p>The Sierras are here two parallel summit
ranges. We were upon the crest of the western
range, and looked down into a gulf 5,000 feet
deep, sinking from our feet in abrupt cliffs nearly
or quite 2,000 feet, whose base plunged into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
broad field of snow lying steep and smooth for a
great distance, but broken near its foot by craggy
steps often a thousand feet high.</p>

<p>Vague blue haze obscured the lost depths,
hiding details, giving a bottomless distance out
of which, like the breath of wind, floated up a
faint treble, vibrating upon the senses, yet
never clearly heard.</p>

<p>Rising on the other side, cliff above cliff, precipice
piled upon precipice, rock over rock, up
against sky, towered the most gigantic mountain-wall
in America, culminating in a noble pile of
gothic-finished granite and enamel-like snow.
How grand and inviting looked its white form,
its untrodden, unknown crest, so high and pure
in the clear strong blue! I looked at it as one
contemplating the purpose of his life; and for
just one moment I would have rather liked to
dodge that purpose, or to have waited, or to have
found some excellent reason why I might not
go; but all this quickly vanished, leaving a cheerful
resolve to go ahead.</p>

<p>From the two opposing mountain-walls singular,
thin, knife-blade ridges of stone jutted
out, dividing the sides of the gulf into a series of
amphitheatres, each one a labyrinth of ice and
rock. Piercing thick beds of snow, sprang up
knobs and straight isolated spires of rock, mere
obelisks curiously carved by frost, their rigid
slender forms casting a blue, sharp shadow upon
the snow. Embosomed in depressions of ice, or
resting on broken ledges, were azure lakes, deeper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
in tone than the sky, which at this altitude, even
at midday, has a violet duskiness.</p>

<p>To the south, not more than eight miles, a wall
of peaks stood across the gulf, dividing the
King's, which flowed north at our feet, from the
Kern River, that flowed down the trough in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>I did not wonder that Brewer and Hoffman
pronounced our undertaking impossible; but
when I looked at Cotter there was such complete
bravery in his eye that I asked him if he were
ready to start. His old answer, &ldquo;Why not?,&rdquo;
left the initiative with me; so I told Professor
Brewer that we would bid him good-bye. Our
friends helped us on with our packs in silence,
and as we shook hands there was not a dry eye
in the party. Before he let go of my hand Professor
Brewer asked me for my plan, and I had
to own that I had but one, which was to reach
the highest peak in the range.</p>

<p>After looking in every direction I was obliged
to confess that I saw as yet no practicable way.
We bade them a &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; receiving their
&ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; in return, and started southward
along the range to look for some possible
cliff to descend. Brewer, Gardner, and Hoffman
turned north to push upward to the summit of
Mount Brewer, and complete their observations.
We saw them whenever we halted, until at last,
on the very summit, their microscopic forms
were for the last time visible. With very great
difficulty we climbed a peak which surmounted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
our wall just to the south of the pass, and, looking
over the eastern brink, found that the precipice
was still sheer and unbroken. In one place,
where the snow lay against it to the very top, we
went to its edge and contemplated the slide.
About three thousand feet of unbroken white, at
a fearfully steep angle, lay below us. We threw
a stone over it and watched it bound until it
was lost in the distance; after fearful leaps we
could only detect it by the flashings of snow
where it struck, and as these were in some instances
three hundred feet apart, we decided not
to launch our own valuable bodies, and the still
more precious barometer, after it.</p>

<p>There seemed but one possible way to reach
our goal; that was to make our way along the
summit of the cross ridge which projected between
the two ranges. This divide sprang out
from our Mount Brewer wall, about four miles
to the south of us. To reach it we must climb
up and down over the indented edge of the Mount
Brewer wall. In attempting to do this we had
a rather lively time scaling a sharp granite needle,
where we found our course completely stopped
by precipices four and five hundred feet in height.
Ahead of us the summit continued to be broken
into fantastic pinnacles, leaving us no hope of
making our way along it; so we sought the most
broken part of the eastern descent, and began
to climb down. The heavy knapsacks, besides
wearing our shoulders gradually into a black-and-blue
state, overbalanced us terribly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
kept us in constant danger of pitching headlong.
At last, taking them off, Cotter climbed down
until he found a resting-place upon a cleft of
rock, then I lowered them to him with our lasso,
afterwards descending cautiously to his side,
taking my turn in pioneering downward, receiving
the freight of knapsacks as before. In this
manner we consumed more that half the afternoon
in descending a thousand feet of broken,
precipitous slope; and it was almost sunset when
we found ourselves upon fields of level snow
which lay white and thick over the whole interior
slope of the amphitheatre. The gorge below us
seemed utterly impassable. At our backs the
Mount Brewer wall either rose in sheer cliffs or
in broken, rugged stairway, such as had offered
us our descent. From this cruel dilemma the
cross divide furnished the only hope, and the
sole chance of scaling that was at its junction
with the Mount Brewer wall. Toward this
point we directed our course, marching wearily
over stretches of dense frozen snow, and regions
of d&eacute;bris, reaching about sunset the last alcove
of the amphitheatre, just at the foot of the Mount
Brewer wall. It was evidently impossible for
us to attempt to climb it that evening, and we
looked about the desolate recesses for a sheltered
camping-spot. A high granite wall surrounded
us upon three sides, recurring to the southward
in long elliptical curves; no part of the summit
being less than 2,000 feet above us, the higher
crags not infrequently reaching 3,000 feet. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
single field of snow swept around the base of the
rock, and covered the whole amphitheatre, except
where a few spikes and rounded masses of granite
rose through it, and where two frozen lakes, with
their blue ice-disks, broke the monotonous surface.
Through the white snow-gate of our
amphitheatre, as through a frame, we looked
eastward upon the summit group; not a tree,
not a vestige of vegetation in sight,&mdash;sky, snow,
and granite the only elements in this wild
picture.</p>

<p>After searching for a shelter we at last found
a granite crevice near the margin of one of the
frozen lakes,&mdash;a sort of shelf just large enough
for Cotter and me,&mdash;where we hastened to make
our bed, having first filled the canteen from a
small stream that trickled over the ice, knowing
that in a few moments the rapid chill would
freeze it. We ate our supper of cold venison
and bread, and whittled from the sides of the
wooden barometer case shaving enough to warm
water for a cup of miserably tepid tea, and then,
packing our provisions and instruments away at
the head of the shelf, rolled ourselves in our
blankets and lay down to enjoy the view.</p>

<p>After such fatiguing exercises the mind has
an almost abnormal clearness: whether this is
wholly from within, or due to the intensely vitalizing
mountain air, I am not sure; probably both
contribute to the state of exaltation in which all
alpine climbers find themselves. The solid
granite gave me a luxurious repose, and I lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
on the edge of our little rock niche and watched
the strange yet brilliant scene.</p>

<p>All the snow of our recess lay in the shadow of
the high granite wall to the west, but the Kern
divide which curved around us from the southeast
was in full light; its broken sky-line, battlemented
and adorned with innumerable rough-hewn
spires and pinnacles, was a mass of glowing
orange intensely defined against the deep violet
sky. At the open end of our horseshoe amphitheatre,
to the east, its floor of snow rounded over
in a smooth brink, overhanging precipices which
sank 2,000 feet into the King's Ca&ntilde;on. Across
the gulf rose the whole procession of summit
peaks, their lower half rooted in a deep sombre
shadow cast by the western wall, the heights
bathed in a warm purple haze, in which the
irregular marbling of snow burned with a pure
crimson light. A few fleecy clouds, dyed fiery
orange, drifted slowly eastward across the narrow
zone of sky which stretched from summit to
summit like a roof. At times the sound of waterfalls,
faint and mingled with echoes, floated up
through the still air. The snow near by lay in
cold ghastly shade, warmed here and there in
strange flashes by light reflected downward from
drifting clouds. The sombre waste about us;
the deep violet vault overhead; those far summits,
glowing with reflected rose; the deep impenetrable
gloom which filled the gorge, and
slowly and with vapour-like stealth climbed the
mountain wall, extinguishing the red light, combined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to produce an effect which may not be
described; nor can I more than hint at the contrast
between the brilliancy of the scene under
full light, and the cold, death-like repose which
followed when the wan cliffs and pallid snow
were all overshadowed with ghostly gray.</p>

<p>A sudden chill enveloped us. Stars in a moment
crowded through the dark heaven, flashing
with a frosty splendour. The snow congealed,
the brooks ceased to flow, and, under the powerful
sudden leverage of frost, immense blocks were
dislodged all along the mountain summits and
came thundering down the slopes, booming upon
the ice, dashing wildly upon rocks. Under the
lee of our shelf we felt quite safe, but neither
Cotter nor I could help being startled, and jumping
just a little, as these missiles, weighing often
many tons, struck the ledge over our heads and
whizzed down the gorge, their stroke resounding
fainter and fainter, until at last only a confused
echo reached us.</p>

<p>The thermometer at nine o'clock marked
twenty degrees above zero. We set the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo;
and rolled ourselves together for the night.
The longer I lay the less I liked that shelf of
granite; it grew hard in time, and cold also, my
bones seeming to approach actual contact with
the chilled rock; moreover, I found that even so
vigorous a circulation as mine was not enough to
warm up the ledge to anything like a comfortable
temperature. A single thickness of blanket is a
better mattress than none, but the larger crystals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of orthoclase, protruding plentifully, punched
my back and caused me to revolve on a horizontal
axis with precision and accuracy. How I
loved Cotter! how I hugged him and got warm,
while our backs gradually petrified, till we whirled
over and thawed them out together! The slant
of that bed was diagonal and excessive; down it
we slid till the ice chilled us awake, and we
crawled back and chocked ourselves up with bits
of granite inserted under my ribs and shoulders.
In this pleasant position we got dozing again,
and there stole over me a most comfortable ease.
The granite softened perceptibly. I was delightfully
warm and sank into an industrious
slumber which lasted with great soundness until
four, when we arose and ate our breakfast of
frozen venison.</p>

<p>The thermometer stood at two above zero;
everything was frozen tight except the canteen,
which we had prudently kept between us all
night. Stars still blazed brightly, and the moon,
hidden from us by western cliffs, shone in pale
reflection upon the rocky heights to the east,
which rose, dimly white, up from the impenetrable
shadows of the ca&ntilde;on. Silence,&mdash;cold,
ghastly dimness, in which loomed huge forms,&mdash;the
biting frostiness of the air, wrought upon our
feelings as we shouldered our packs and started
with slow pace to climb up the &ldquo;divide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon, to our dismay, we found the straps had
so chafed our shoulders that the weight gave us
great pain, and obliged us to pad them with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
handkerchiefs and extra socks, which remedy did
not wholly relieve us from the constant wearing
pain of the heavy load.</p>

<p>Directing our steps southward toward a niche
in the wall which bounded us only half a mile
distant, we travelled over a continuous snow-field
frozen so densely as scarcely to yield at all
to our tread, at the same time compressing
enough to make that crisp frosty sound which
we all used to enjoy even before we knew from
the books that it had something to do with the
severe name of regelation.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the snow sloped more and
more steeply up toward the crags, till by and by
it became quite dangerous, causing us to cut
steps with Cotter's large bowie-knife,&mdash;a slow,
tedious operation, requiring patience of a pretty
permanent kind. In this way we spent a quiet
social hour or so. The sun had not yet reached
us, being shut out by the high amphitheatre wall;
but its cheerful light reflected downward from
a number of higher crags, filling the recess with
the brightness of day, and putting out of existence
those shadows which so sombrely darkened
the earlier hours. To look back when we stopped
to rest was to realize our danger,&mdash;that smooth,
swift slope of ice carrying the eye down a thousand
feet to the margin of a frozen mirror of ice;
ribs and needles of rocks piercing up through the
snow, so closely grouped that, had we fallen, a
miracle only might have saved us from being
dashed. This led to rather deeper steps, and greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
care that our burdens should be held more
nearly over the centre of gravity, and a pleasant
relief when we got to the top of the snow and sat
down on a block of granite to breathe and look up
in search of a way up the thousand-foot cliff of
broken surface, among the lines of fracture and
the galleries winding along the face.</p>

<p>It would have disheartened us to gaze up the
hard sheer front of precipices, and search among
splintered projections, crevices, shelves, and snow
patches for an inviting route, had we not been
animated by a faith that the mountains could
not defy us.</p>

<p>Choosing what looked like the least impossible
way, we started; but, finding it unsafe to work
with packs on, resumed the yesterday's plan,&mdash;Cotter
taking the lead, climbing about fifty feet
ahead, and hoisting up the knapsacks and barometer
as I tied them to the end of the lasso.
Constantly closing up in hopeless difficulty before
us, the way opened again and again to our gymnastics,
till we stood together on a mere shelf,
not more than two feet wide, which led diagonally
up the smooth cliff. Edging along in careful
steps, our backs flattened upon the granite, we
moved slowly to a broad platform, where we
stopped for breath.</p>

<p>There was no foothold above us. Looking
down over the course we had come, it seemed,
and I really believe it was, an impossible descent
for one can climb upward with safety where he
cannot downward. To turn back was to give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
up in defeat; and, we sat at least half an hour,
suggesting all possible routes to the summit,
accepting none, and feeling disheartened. About
thirty feet directly over our heads was another
shelf, which, if we could reach, seemed to offer
at least a temporary way upward. On its edge
were two or three spikes of granite; whether
firmly connected with the cliff, or merely blocks
of d&eacute;bris, we could not tell from below. I said
to Cotter, I thought of but one possible plan:
it was to lasso one of these blocks, and to climb,
sailor-fashion, hand over hand, up the rope.
In the lasso I had perfect confidence, for I had
seen more than one Spanish bull throw his whole
weight against it without parting a strand. The
shelf was so narrow that throwing the coil of rope
was a very difficult undertaking. I tried three
times, and Cotter spent five minutes vainly whirling
the loop up at the granite spikes. At last I
made a lucky throw, and it tightened upon one
of the smaller protuberances. I drew the noose
close, and very gradually threw my hundred and
fifty pounds upon the rope; then Cotter joined
me, and, for a moment, we both hung our united
weight upon it. Whether the rock moved
slightly or whether the lasso stretched a little
we were unable to decide; but the trial must be
made, and I began to climb slowly. The smooth
precipice-face against which my body swung
offered no foothold, and the whole climb had
therefore to be done by the arms, an effort requiring
all one's determination. When about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
half way up I was obliged to rest, and, curling
my feet in the rope, managed to relieve my arms
for a moment. In this position I could not
resist the fascinating temptation of a survey
downward.</p>

<p>Straight down, nearly a thousand feet below,
at the foot of the rocks, began the snow, whose
steep, roof-like slope, exaggerated into an almost
vertical angle, curved down in a long white field,
broken far away by rocks and polished, round
lakes of ice.</p>

<p>Cotter looked up cheerfully and asked how
I was making it; to which I answered that I had
plenty of wind left. At that moment, when
hanging between heaven and earth, it was a
deep satisfaction to look down at the wide gulf of
desolation beneath, and up to unknown dangers
ahead, and feel my nerves cool and unshaken.</p>

<p>A few pulls hand over hand brought me to
the edge of the shelf, when, throwing my arm
around the granite spike. I swung my body upon
the shelf and lay down to rest, shouting to Cotter
that I was all right, and that the prospects upward
were capital. After a few moments'
breathing I looked over the brink and directed
my comrade to tie the barometer to the lower
end of the lasso, which he did, and that precious
instrument was hoisted to my station, and the
lasso sent down twice for knapsacks, after which
Cotter came up the rope in his very muscular
way without once stopping to rest. We took
our loads in our hands, swinging the barometer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
over my shoulder, and climbed up a shelf which
led in a zig-zag direction upward and to the
south, bringing us out at last upon the thin blade
of a ridge which connected a short distance above
the summit. It was formed of huge blocks,
shattered, and ready, at a touch, to fall.</p>

<p>So narrow and sharp was the upper slope,
that we dared not walk, but got astride, and
worked slowly along with our hands, pushing
the knapsacks in advance, now and then holding
our breath when loose masses rocked under our
weight.</p>

<p>Once upon the summit, a grand view burst
upon us. Hastening to step upon the crest of
the divide, which was never more than ten feet
wide, frequently sharpened to a mere blade, we
looked down upon the other side, and were astonished
to find we had ascended the gentler
slope, and that the rocks fell from our feet in
almost vertical precipices for a thousand feet or
more. A glance along the summit toward the
highest group showed us that any advance in
that direction was impossible, for the thin ridge
was gashed down in notches three or four hundred
feet deep, forming a procession of pillars, obelisks,
and blocks piled upon each other, and looking
terribly insecure.</p>

<p>We then deposited our knapsacks in a safe
place, and, finding that it was already noon,
determined to rest a little while and take a lunch
at over 13,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>West of us stretched the Mount Brewer wall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with its succession of smooth precipices and amphitheatre
ridges. To the north the great gorge
of the King's River yawned down 5,000 feet. To
the south, the valley of the Kern, opening in
the opposite direction, was broader, less deep,
but more filled with broken masses of granite.
Clustered about the foot of the divide were a
dozen alpine lakes; the higher ones blue sheets of
ice, the lowest completely melted. Still lower
in the depths of the two ca&ntilde;ons we could see
groups of forest trees; but they were so dim and
so distant as never to relieve the prevalent
masses of rock and snow. Our divide cast its
shadow for a mile down King's Ca&ntilde;on in dark-blue
profile upon the broad sheets of sunny snow,
from whose brightness the hard splintered cliffs
caught reflections and wore an aspect of joy.
Thousands of rills poured from the melting snow,
filling the air with a musical tinkle as of many
accordant bells. The Kern Valley opened below
us with its smooth oval outline, the work of extinct
glaciers, whose form and extent were evident
from worn cliff surface and rounded wall; snow-fields,
relics of the former <i>neve</i> [glacier snow]
hung in white tapestries around its ancient birthplace;
and, as far as we could see, the broad,
corrugated valley, for a breadth of fully ten miles,
shone with burnishings wherever its granite surface
was not covered with lakelets or thickets of
alpine vegetation.</p>

<p>Through a deep cut in the Mount Brewer wall
we gained our first view to the westward, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
saw in the distance the wall of the South King's
Ca&ntilde;on, and the granite point which Cotter and I
had climbed a fortnight before. But for the
haze we might have seen the plain; for above
its farther limit were several points of the Coast
Ranges, isolated like islands in the sea.</p>

<p>The view was so grand, the mountain colours
so brilliant, immense snow-fields and blue alpine
lakes so charming, that we almost forgot we were
ever to move, and it was only after a swift hour
of this delight that we began to consider our
future course.</p>

<p>The King's Ca&ntilde;on, which headed against our
wall, seemed untraversable,&mdash;no human being
could climb along the divide; we had then but
one hope of reaching the peak, and our greatest
difficulty lay at the start. If we could climb
down to the Kern side of the divide, and succeed
in reaching the base of the precipices which fell
from our feet, it really looked as if we might
travel without difficulty among the rocks to the
other side of the Kern Valley, and make our attempt
upon the southward flank of the great peak.
One look at the sublime white giant decided us.
We looked down over the precipice, and at first
could see no method of descent. Then we went
back and looked at the road we had come up, to
see if that were not possibly as bad; but the
broken surface of the rocks was evidently much
better climbing-ground than anything ahead of
us. Cotter, with danger, edged his way along the
wall to the east, and I to the west, to see if there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
might not be some favourable point; but we
both returned with the belief that the precipice
in front of us was as passable as any of it. Down
it we must.</p>

<p>After lying on our faces, looking over the brink
ten or twenty minutes, I suggested that by lowering
ourselves on the rope we might climb from
crevice to crevice; but we saw no shelf large
enough for ourselves and the knapsacks too.
However, we were not going to give it up without
a trial; and I made the rope fast around my breast
and, looping the noose over a firm point of rock,
let myself slide gradually down to a notch forty
feet below. There was only room beside me for
Cotter, so I had him send down the knapsacks
first. I then tied these together by the straps
with my silk handkerchiefs, and hung them as far
to the left as I could reach without losing my
balance, looping the handkerchiefs over a point
of rock. Cotter then slid down the rope, and,
with considerable difficulty, we whipped the
noose off its resting-place above, and cut off our
connection with the upper world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We're in for it now, King,&rdquo; remarked my
comrade, as he looked aloft, and then down; but
our blood was up, and danger added only an
exhilarating thrill to the nerves.</p>

<p>The shelf was hardly more than two feet wide,
and the granite so smooth that we could find no
place to fasten the lasso for the next descent;
so I determined to try the climb with only as
little aid as possible. Tying it round my breast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
again, I gave the other end into Cotter's hands,
and he, bracing his back against the cliff, found
for himself as firm a foothold as he could, and
promised to give me all the help in his power.
I made up my mind to bear no weight unless it
was absolutely necessary; and for the first ten
feet I found cracks and protuberances enough
to support me, making every square inch of surface
do friction duty, and hugging myself against
the rocks as tightly as I could. When within
about eight feet of the next shelf, I twisted myself
round upon the face, hanging by two rough
blocks of protruding feldspar, and looked vainly
for some further hand-hold; but the rock, besides
being perfectly smooth, overhung slightly, and
my legs dangled in the air. I saw that the next
cleft was over three feet broad, and I thought,
possibly, I might, by a quick slide, reach it in
safety without endangering Cotter. I shouted
to him to be very careful and let go in case I
fell, loosened my hold upon the rope, and slid
quickly down. My shoulder struck against the
rock and threw me out of balance; for an instant
I reeled over upon the verge, in danger of falling,
but, in the excitement, I thrust out my hand
and seized a small alpine gooseberry bush, the
first piece of vegetation we had seen. Its roots
were so firmly fixed in the crevice that it held
my weight and saved me.</p>

<p>I could no longer see Cotter, but I talked to
him, and heard the two knapsacks come bumping
along until they slid over the eaves above me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and swung down to my station, when I seized the
lasso's end and braced myself as well as possible,
intending, if he slipped, to haul in slack and help
him as best I might. As he came slowly down
from crack to crack, I heard his hobnailed shoes
grating on the granite; presently they appeared
dangling from the eaves above my head. I had
gathered in the rope until it was taut, and then
hurriedly told him to drop. He hesitated a
moment and let go. Before he struck the rock
I had him by the shoulder, and whirled him
down upon his side, thus preventing his rolling
overboard, which friendly action he took quite
coolly.</p>

<p>The third descent was not a difficult one, nor
the fourth; but when we had climbed down about
two hundred and fifty feet the rocks were so
glacially polished and water-worn that it seemed
impossible to get any farther. To our right was
a crack penetrating the rock perhaps a foot deep,
widening at the surface to three or four inches,
which proved to be the only possible ladder.
As the chances seemed rather desperate, we concluded
to tie ourselves together, in order to share
a common fate; and with a slack of thirty feet
between us, and our knapsacks upon our backs,
we climbed into the crevice, and began descending
with our faces to the cliff. This had to be
done with unusual caution, for the foothold was
about as good as none, and our fingers slipped
annoyingly on the smooth stone; besides the
knapsacks and instruments kept a steady backward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
pull, tending to overbalance us. But we
took pains to descend one at a time, and rest
wherever the niches gave our feet a safe support.
In this way we got down about eighty feet of
smooth, nearly vertical wall, reaching the top of
a rude granite stairway, which led to the snow;
and here we sat down to rest, and found to our
astonishment that we had been three hours from
the summit.</p>

<p>After breathing a half-minute we continued
down, jumping from rock to rock, and, having
by practice become very expert in balancing ourselves,
sprang on, never resting long enough to
lose equilibrium, and in this manner made a
quick descent over rugged d&eacute;bris to the crest of
a snow-field, which, for seven or eight hundred
feet more, swept down in a smooth, even slope,
of very high angle, to the borders of a frozen
lake.</p>

<p>Without untying the lasso which bound us
together, we sprang upon the snow with a shout,
and slid down splendidly, turning now and then
a somersault, and shooting out like cannon-balls
almost to the middle of the frozen lake; I upon
my back, and Cotter feet first, in a swimming
position. The ice cracked in all directions. It
was only a thin, transparent film, through which
we could see deep into the lake. Untying ourselves,
we hurried ashore in different directions,
lest our combined weight should be too great a
strain upon any point.</p>

<p>With curiosity and wonder we scanned every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
shelf and niche of the last descent. It seemed
quite impossible that we could have come down
there, and now it actually was beyond human
power to get back again. But what cared we?
&ldquo;Sufficient unto the day&rdquo;&mdash;We were bound
for that still distant, though gradually nearing,
summit; and we had come from a cold shadowed
cliff into deliciously warm sunshine, and were
jolly, shouting, singing songs, and calling out the
companionship of a hundred echoes. Six miles
away, with no grave danger, no great difficulty,
between us, lay the base of our grand mountain.
Upon its skirts we saw a little grove of pines, an
ideal bivouac, and toward this we bent our course.</p>

<p>After the continued climbing of the day, walking
was a delicious rest, and forward we pressed
with considerable speed, our hobnails giving us
firm footing on the glittering glacial surface.
Every fluting of the great valley was in itself a
considerable ca&ntilde;on, into which we descended,
climbing down the scored rocks, and swinging
from block to block, until we reached the level
of the pines. Here, sheltered among loose rocks,
began to appear little fields of alpine grass, pale
yet sunny, soft under our feet, fragrantly jewelled
with flowers of fairy delicacy, holding up amid
thickly clustered blades chalices of turquoise and
amethyst, white stars, and fiery little globes of
red. Lakelets, small but innumerable, were held
in glacial basins, the scorings and grooves of that
old dragon's track ornamenting their smooth
bottoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>One of these, a sheet of pure beryl hue, gave
us as much pleasure from its lovely transparency,
and because we lay down in the necklace of grass
about it and smelled flowers, while tired muscles
relaxed upon warm beds of verdure, and the pain
in our burdened shoulders went away, leaving us
delightfully comfortable.</p>

<p>After the stern grandeur of granite and ice,
and with the peaks and walls still in view, it was
relief to find ourselves again in the region of
life. I never felt for trees and flowers such a
sense of intimate relationship and sympathy.
When we had no longer excuse for resting, I
invented the palpable subterfuge of measuring
the altitude of the spot, since the few clumps of
low, wide-boughed pines near by were the highest
living trees. So we lay longer with less and
less will to rise, and when resolution called us to
our feet the getting up was sorely like Rip Van
Winkle's in the third act.</p>

<p>The deep glacial ca&ntilde;on-flutings across which
our march then lay proved to be great consumers
of time; indeed it was sunset when we reached the
eastern ascent, and began to toil up through
scattered pines, and over trains of moraine
[glacial] rocks, toward the great peak. Stars were
already flashing brilliantly in the sky, and the
low glowing arch in the west had almost vanished
when we reached the upper trees, and threw
down our knapsacks to camp. The forest grew
on a sort of plateau-shelf with a precipitous front
to the west,&mdash;a level surface which stretched eastward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
and back to the foot of our mountain,
whose lower spurs reached within a mile of camp.
Within the shelter lay a huge fallen log, like all
these alpine woods one mass of resin, which flared
up when we applied a match, illuminating the
whole grove. By contrast with the darkness outside,
we seemed to be in a vast, many-pillared
hall. The stream close by afforded water for
our blessed teapot; venison frizzled with mild,
appetizing sound upon the ends of pine sticks;
matchless beans allowed themselves to become
seductively crisp upon our tin plates. That supper
seemed to me then the quintessence of gastronomy,
and I am sure Cotter and I must have
said some very good after-dinner things, though
I long ago forgot them all. Within the ring of
warmth, on elastic beds of pine-needles, we
curled up, and fell swiftly into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>I woke up once in the night to look at my
watch, and observed that the sky was overcast
with a thin film of cirrus cloud to which the reflected
moonlight lent the appearance of a glimmering
tint, stretched from mountain to mountain
over ca&ntilde;ons filled with impenetrable darkness,
only the vaguely-lighted peaks and white
snow-fields distinctly seen. I closed my eyes and
slept soundly until Cotter awoke me at half-past
three, when we arose, breakfasted by the light of
our fire, which still blazed brilliantly, and, leaving
our knapsacks, started for the mountain with
only instruments, canteens, and luncheon.</p>

<p>In the indistinct moonlight climbing was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
difficult at first, for we had to thread our way
along a plain which was literally covered with
glacier boulders, and the innumerable brooks
which we crossed were frozen solid. However,
our march brought us to the base of the great
mountain, which, rising high against the east,
shut out the coming daylight, and kept us in profound
shadow. From base to summit rose a
series of broken crags, lifting themselves from a
general slope of d&eacute;bris. Toward the left the
angle seemed to be rather gentler, and the surface
less ragged; and we hoped, by a long d&eacute;tour round
the base, to make an easy climb up this gentler
surface. So we toiled on for an hour over the
rocks, reaching at last the bottom of the north
slope. Here our work began in good earnest.
The blocks were of enormous size, and in every
stage of unstable equilibrium, frequently rolling
over as we jumped upon them, making it necessary
for us to take a second leap and land where
we best could. To our relief we soon surmounted
the largest blocks, reaching a smaller size, which
served us as a sort of stairway.</p>

<p>The advancing daylight revealed to us a very
long, comparatively even snow-slope, whose surface
was pierced by many knobs and granite
heads, giving it the aspect of a nice-roofing fastened
on with bolts of stone. It stretched in far
perspective to the summit, where already the
rose of sunrise reflected gloriously, kindling a
fresh enthusiasm within us.</p>

<p>Immense boulders were partly imbedded in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
ice just above us, whose constant melting left
them trembling on the edge of a fall. It communicated
no very pleasant sensation to see above
you these immense missiles hanging by a mere
band, and knowing that, as soon as the sun rose,
you would be exposed to a constant cannonade.</p>

<p>The east side of the peak, which we could now
partially see, was too precipitous to think of
climbing. The slope toward our camp was too
much broken into pinnacles and crags to offer
us any hope, or to divert us from the single way,
dead ahead, up slopes of ice and among fragments
of granite. The sun rose upon us while we were
climbing the lower part of this snow, and in less
than half an hour, melting began to liberate huge
blocks, which thundered down past us, gathering
and growing into small avalanches below.</p>

<p>We did not dare climb one above another,
according to our ordinary mode, but kept about
an equal level, a hundred feet apart, lest, dislodging
the blocks, one should hurl them down
upon the other.</p>

<p>We climbed alternately up smooth faces of
granite, clinging simply by the cracks and protruding
crystals of feldspar, and then hewed steps
up fearfully steep slopes of ice, zigzagging to the
right and left to avoid the flying boulders. When
midway up this slope we reached a place where
the granite rose in perfectly smooth bluffs on
either side of a gorge,&mdash;a narrow cut, or walled
way, leading up to the flat summit of the cliff.
This we scaled by cutting ice steps, only to find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ourselves fronted again by a still higher wall. Ice
sloped from its front at too steep an angle for us
to follow, but had melted in contact with it, leaving
a space three feet wide between the ice and
the rock. We entered this crevice and climbed
along its bottom, with a wall of rock rising a
hundred feet above us on one side, and a thirty-foot
face of ice on the other, through which light
of an intense cobalt-blue penetrated.</p>

<p>Reaching the upper end, we had to cut our
footsteps upon the ice again, and, having braced
our backs against the granite, climb up to the surface.
We were now in a dangerous position: to
fall into the crevice upon one side was to be
wedged to death between rock and ice; to make
a slip was to be shot down five hundred feet, and
then hurled over the brink of a precipice. In the
friendly seat which this wedge gave me, I stopped
to take wet and dry observations with the thermometer,&mdash;this
being an absolute preventive of a
scare,&mdash;and to enjoy the view.</p>

<p>The wall of our mountain sank abruptly to the
left, opening for the first time an outlook to the
eastward. Deep&mdash;it seemed almost vertically&mdash;beneath
us we could see the blue waters of Owen's
Lake, 10,000 feet below. The summit peaks to
the north were piled up in titanic confusion,
their ridges overhanging the eastern slope with
terrible abruptness. Clustered upon the shelves
and plateaus below were several frozen lakes, and
in all directions swept magnificent fields of snow.
The summit was now not over five hundred feet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
distant, and we started on again with the exhilarating
hope of success. But if Nature had intended
to secure the summit from all assailants,
she could not have planned her defences better;
for the smooth granite wall which rose above the
snow-slope continued, apparently, quite round
the peak, and we looked in great anxiety to see
if there was not one place where it might be
climbed. It was all blank except in one place;
quite near us the snow bridged across the crevice,
and rose in a long point to the summit of the wall,&mdash;a
great icicle-column frozen in a niche of the
bluff,&mdash;its base about ten feet wide, narrowing to
two feet at the top. We climbed to the base of
this spire of ice, and, with the utmost care, began
to cut our stairway. The material was an exceedingly
compacted snow, passing into clear ice
as it neared the rock. We climbed the first half
of it with comparative ease; after that it was
almost vertical, and so thin that we did not dare
to cut the footsteps deep enough to make them
absolutely safe. There was a constant dread
lest out ladder should break off, and we be
thrown either down the snow-slope or into the
bottom of the crevasse. At last, in order to prevent
myself from falling over backwards, I was
obliged to thrust my hand into the crack between
the ice and the wall, and the spire became so
narrow that I could do this on both sides; so that
the climb was made as upon a tree, cutting mere
toe-holes and embracing the whole column of ice
in my arms. At last I reached the top, and, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
the greatest caution, wormed my body over the
brink, and rolling out upon the smooth surface of
the granite, looked over and watched Cotter
make his climb. He came up steadily, with no
sense of nervousness, until he got to the narrow
part of the ice, and here he stopped and looked up
with a forlorn face to me; but as he climbed up
over the ledge the broad smile came back to his
face, and he asked me if it had occurred to me
that we had, by and by, to go down again.</p>

<p>We had now an easy slope to the summit, and
hurried up over rocks and ice, reaching the crest
at exactly twelve o'clock. I rang my hammer
upon the topmost rock; we grasped hands, and I
reverently named the grand peak <span class="smcap">Mount Tyndall</span>.</p>

<p><i>August 13, 1869.</i> We are now ready to start
on our way down the Great Unknown. Our
boats, tied to a common stake, are chafing each
other, as they are tossed by the fretful river.
They ride high and buoyant, for their loads
are lighter than we could desire. We have
but a month's rations remaining. The flour
has been resifted through the mosquito net
sieve; the spoiled bacon has been dried, and
the worst of it boiled; the few pounds of dried
apples have been spread in the sun, and reshrunken
to their normal bulk; the sugar has
all melted, and gone on its way down the river;
but we have a large sack of coffee. The lightening
of the boats has this advantage: they will ride<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the waves better, and we shall have but little
to carry when we make a portage.</p>

<p>We are three-quarters of a mile in the depths
of the earth, and the great river shrinks into
insignificance, as it dashes its angry waves
against the walls and cliffs, that rise to the
world above; they are but puny ripples, and
we but pigmies, running up and down the sands,
or lost among the boulders.</p>

<p>We have an unknown distance yet to run;
an unknown river yet to explore. What falls
there are, we know not; what rocks beset the
channel, we know not; what walls rise over
the river, we know not. Ah, well! we may
conjecture many things. The men talk as cheerfully
as ever; jests are bandied out freely this
morning; but to me the cheer is sombre and
the jests are ghastly.</p>

<p>With some eagerness, and some anxiety,
and some misgiving, we enter the ca&ntilde;on below,
and are carried along by the swift water through
walls which rise from its very edge. They have
the same structure as we noticed yesterday&mdash;tiers
of irregular shelves below, and, above
these, steep slopes to the foot of marble cliffs.
We run six miles in a little more than half an
hour, and emerge into a more open portion
of the ca&ntilde;on, where high hills and ledges of
rock intervene between the river and the distant
walls. Just at the head of this open place
the river runs across a dike; that is, a fissure
in the rocks, open to depths below, has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
filled with eruptive matter, and this, on cooling,
was harder than the rocks through which the
crevice was made, and, when these were washed
away, the harder volcanic matter remained as
a wall, and the river has cut a gateway through
it several hundred feet high, and as many wide.
As it crosses the wall, there is a fall below,
and a bad rapid, filled with boulders of trap;
so we stop to make a portage. Then on we go,
gliding by hills and ledges, with distant walls
in view; sweeping past sharp angles of rock;
stopping at a few points to examine rapids,
which we find can be run, until we have
made another five miles, when we land for
dinner.</p>

<p>Then we let down with lines, over a long
rapid, and start again. Once more the walls
close in, and we find ourselves in a narrow gorge,
the water again filling the channel, and very
swift. With great care and constant watchfulness
we proceed, making about four miles this
afternoon, and camp in a cave.</p>

<p><i>August 14.</i> At daybreak we walk down the
bank of the river, on a little sandy beach, to take
a view of a new feature in the ca&ntilde;on. Heretofore
hard rocks have given us bad river; soft rocks,
smooth water; and a series of rocks harder than
any we have experienced sets in. The river
enters the granite!<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>We can see but a little way into the granite
gorge, but it looks threatening.</p>

<p>After breakfast we enter on the waves. At
the very introduction, it inspires awe. The
ca&ntilde;on is narrower than we have ever before seen
it; the water is swifter; there are but few broken
rocks in the channel; but the walls are set, on
either side, with pinnacles and crags; and sharp,
angular buttresses, bristling with wind and wave-polished
spires, extend far out into the river.</p>

<p>Ledges of rock jut into the stream, their tops
just below the surface, sometimes rising few or
many feet above; and island ledges, and island
pinnacles, and island towers break the swift
course of the stream into chutes, and eddies, and
whirlpools. We soon reach a place where a creek
comes in from the left, and just below the channel
is choked with boulders, which have washed down
this lateral ca&ntilde;on and formed a dam, over which
there is a fall of thirty or forty feet; but on the
boulders we can get foothold, and we make a
portage.</p>

<p>Three more such dams are found. Over one
we make a portage; at the other two we find
chutes, through which we can run.</p>

<p>As we proceed, the granite rises higher, until
nearly a thousand feet of the lower part of the
walls are composed of this rock.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock we hear a great roar
ahead, and approach it very cautiously. The
sound grows louder and louder as we run, and at
last we find ourselves above a long, broken fall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
with ledges and pinnacles of rock obstructing the
river. There is a descent of, perhaps, seventy-five
or eighty feet in a third of a mile, and the
rushing waters break into great waves on the
rocks, and lash themselves into a mad, white,
foam. We can land just above, but there is no
foothold on either side by which we can make a
portage. It is nearly a thousand feet to the top
of the granite, so it will be impossible to carry our
boats around, though we can climb to the summit
up a side gulch, and, passing along a mile or
two, can descend to the river. This we find on
examination; but such a portage would be impracticable
for us, and we must run the rapid, or
abandon the river. There is no hesitation. We
step into our boats, push off, and away we go,
first on smooth but swift water, then we strike a
glassy wave, and ride to its top, down again into
the trough, up again on a higher wave, and down
and up on waves higher and still higher, until we
strike one just as it curls back, and a breaker
rolls over our little boat. Still, on we speed,
shooting past projecting rocks, till the little boat
is caught in a whirlpool, and spun around several
times. At last we pull out again into the stream,
and now the other boats have passed us. The
open compartment of the <i>Emma Dean</i> is filled
with water, and every breaker rolls over us.
Hurled back from a rock, now on this side, now
on that, we are carried into an eddy, in which we
struggle for a few minutes, and are then out again,
the breakers still rolling over us. Our boat is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
unmanageable, but she cannot sink, and we drift
down another hundred yards, through breakers;
how, we scarcely know. We find the other boats
have turned into an eddy at the foot of the fall,
and are waiting to catch us as we come, for the
men have seen that our boat is swamped. They
push out as we come near, and pull us in against
the wall. We bail our boat, and on we go again.</p>

<p>The walls, now, are more than a mile in height&mdash;a
vertical distance difficult to appreciate.
Stand on the south steps of the Treasury Building,
in Washington, and look down Pennsylvania
Avenue to the Capitol Park, and measure this
distance overhead, and imagine cliffs to extend to
that altitude, and you will understand what I
mean; or, stand at Canal Street, in New York, and
look up Broadway to Grace Church, and you
have about the distance; or, stand at Lake Street
Bridge in Chicago, and look down to the Central
Depot, and you have it again.</p>

<p>A thousand feet of this is up through granite
crags, then steep slopes and perpendicular cliffs
rise, one above another, to the summit. The
gorge is black and narrow below, red and gray
and flaring above, with crags and angular projections
on the walls, which, cut in many places
by side ca&ntilde;ons, seem to be a vast wilderness of
rocks. Down in these grand, gloomy depths we
glide, ever listening, for the mad waters keep up
their roar; ever watching, ever peering ahead, for
the narrow ca&ntilde;on is winding, and the river is
closed in so that we can see but a few hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
yards, and what there may be below we know
not; but we listen for falls, and watch for rocks,
or stop now and then, in the bay of a recess, to
admire the gigantic scenery. And ever, as we go,
there is some new pinnacle or tower, some crag or
peak, some distant view of the upper plateau,
some strange-shaped rock, or some deep, narrow
side ca&ntilde;on. Then we come to another broken
fall, which appears more difficult than the one we
ran this morning.</p>

<p>A small creek comes in on the right, and the
first fall of the water is over boulders, which have
been carried down by this lateral stream. We
land at its mouth, and stop for an hour or two to
examine the fall. It seems possible to let down
with lines, at least a part of the way, from point
to point, along the right-hand wall. So we make
a portage over the first rocks, and find footing on
some boulders below. Then we let down one of
the boats to the end of her line, when she reaches
a corner of the projecting rock, to which one of
the men clings, and steadies her, while I examine
an eddy below. I think we can pass the other
boats down by us, and catch them in the eddy.
This is soon done and the men in the boats in the
eddy pull us to their side. On the shore of this
little eddy there is about two feet of gravel beach
above the water. Standing on this beach, some
of the men take the line of the little boat and let
it drift down against another projecting angle.
Here is a little shelf, on which a man from my boat
climbs, and a shorter line is passed to him, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
he fastens the boat to the side of the cliff. Then
the second one is let down, bringing the line of
the third. When the second boat is tied up, the
two men standing on the beach above spring into
the last boat, which is pulled up alongside of ours.
Then we let down the boats, for twenty-five or
thirty yards, by walking along the shelf, landing
them again in the mouth of a side ca&ntilde;on. Just
below this there is another pile of boulders, over
which we make another portage. From the foot of
these rocks we can climb to another shelf, forty
or fifty feet above the water.</p>

<p>On this beach we camp for the night. We find
a few sticks, which have lodged in the rocks. It
is raining hard, and we have no shelter, but
kindle a fire and have our supper. We sit on the
rocks all night, wrapped in our ponchos, getting
what sleep we can.</p>

<p><i>August 15.</i> This morning we find we can let
down for three or four hundred yards, and it is
managed in this way: We pass along the wall by
climbing from projecting point to point, sometimes
near the water's edge, at other places fifty
or sixty feet above, and hold the boat with a line,
while two men remain aboard, and prevent her
from being dashed against the rocks, and keep
the line from getting caught in the wall. In two
hours we have brought them all down, as far as it
is possible, in this way. A few yards below, the
river strikes with great violence against a projecting
rock, and our boats are pulled up in a little
bay above. We must now manage to pull out of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
this, and clear the point below. The little boat
is held by the bow obliquely up the stream. We
jump in, and pull out only a few strokes, and
sweep clear of the dangerous rock. The other
boats follow in the same manner, and the rapid
is passed.</p>

<p>It is not easy to describe the labour of such
navigation. We must prevent the waves from
dashing the boats against the cliffs. Sometimes,
where the river is swift, we must put a bight of
rope about a rock, to prevent her being snatched
from us by a wave; but where the plunge is too
great, or the chute too swift, we must let her leap,
and catch her below, or the undertow will drag
her under the falling water, and she sinks. Where
we wish to run her out a little way from shore,
through a channel between rocks, we first throw
in little sticks of driftwood, and watch their
course, to see where we must steer, so that she
will pass the channel in safety. And so we hold,
and let go, and pull, and lift, and ward, among
rocks, around rocks, and over rocks.</p>

<p>And now we go on through this solemn, mysterious
way. The river is very deep, the ca&ntilde;on
very narrow, and still obstructed, so that there
is no steady flow of the stream; but the waters
wheel, and roll, and boil, and we are scarcely able
to determine where we can go. Now, the boat is
carried to the right, perhaps close to the wall;
again, she is shot into the stream, and perhaps
is dragged over to the other side, where, caught
in a whirlpool, she spins about. We can neither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
land nor run as we please. The boats are entirely
unmanageable; no order in their running
can be preserved; now one, now another, is ahead,
each crew labouring for its own preservation.
In such a place we come to another rapid. Two
of the boats run it perforce. One succeeds in
landing, but there is no foothold by which to
make a portage, and she is pushed out again into
the stream. The next minute a great reflex wave
fills the open compartment; she is water-logged,
and drifts unmanageable. Breaker after breaker
roll over her, and one capsizes her. The men are
thrown out; but they cling to the boat, and she
drifts down some distance, alongside of us, and
we are able to catch her. She is soon bailed out,
and the men are aboard once more; but the oars
are lost, so a pair from the <i>Emma Dean</i> is spared.
Then for two miles we find smooth water.</p>

<p>Clouds are playing in the ca&ntilde;on to-day. Sometimes
they roll down in great masses, filling the
gorge with gloom; sometimes they hang above,
from wall to wall, and cover the ca&ntilde;on with a
roof of impending storm; and we can peer long
distances up and down this ca&ntilde;on corridor, with
its cloud roof overhead, its walls of black granite,
and its river bright with the sheen of broken
waters. Then, a gust of wind sweeps down a side
gulch, and, making a rift in the clouds, reveals the
blue heavens, and a stream of sunlight pours in.
Then, the clouds drift away into the distance, and
hang around crags, and peaks, and pinnacles, and
towers, and walls, and cover them with a mantle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
that lifts from time to time, and sets them all in
sharp relief. Then, baby clouds creep out of side
ca&ntilde;ons, glide around points, and creep back again
into more distant gorges. Then, clouds, set in
strata across the ca&ntilde;on, with intervening vista
views, to cliffs and rocks beyond. The clouds
are children of the heavens, and when they play
among the rocks they lift them to the region
above.</p>

<p>It rains! Rapidly little rills are formed above,
and these soon grow into brooks, and the brooks
grow into creeks, and tumble over the walls in
innumerable cascades, adding their wild music to
the roar of the river. When the rain ceases, the
rills, brooks, and creeks run dry. The waters
that fall during a rain on these steep rocks are
gathered at once into the river; they could
scarcely be poured in more suddenly if some vast
spout ran from the clouds to the stream itself.
When a storm bursts over the ca&ntilde;on a side gulch
is dangerous, for a sudden flood may come, and
the inpouring water will raise the river, so as to
hide the rocks before your eyes.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we discover a stream,
entering from the north, a clear, beautiful creek,
coming down through a gorgeous red ca&ntilde;on. We
land, and camp on a sand beach, above its mouth,
under a great, overspreading tree, with willow-shaped
leaves.</p>

<p><i>August 16.</i> We must dry our rations again to-day,
and make oars.</p>

<p>The Colorado is never a clear stream, but for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
the past three or four days it has been raining
much of the time, and the floods, which are
poured over the walls, have brought down great
quantities of mud, making it exceedingly turbid
now. The little affluent, which we have discovered
here, is a clear, beautiful creek, or river,
as it would be termed in this Western country,
where streams are not abundant. We have
named one stream, away above, in honour of the
great chief of the &ldquo;Bad Angels,&rdquo; and, as this is
in beautiful contrast to that, we conclude to name
it &ldquo;Bright Angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early in the morning, the whole party starts
up to explore the Bright Angel River, with the
special purpose of seeking timber, from which to
make oars. A couple of miles above, we find a
large pine log, which has been floated down from
the plateau, probably from an altitude of more
than 6,000 feet, but not many miles back. On its
way, it must have passed over many cataracts
and falls, for it bears scars in evidence of the
rough usage it has received. The men roll it on
skids, and the work of sawing oars is commenced.</p>

<p>This stream heads away back, under a line of
abrupt cliffs, that terminates the plateau, and
tumbles down more than 4,000 feet in the first
mile or two of its course; then runs through a
deep, narrow ca&ntilde;on, until it reaches the river.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<img src="images/il155.png" width="346" height="500" alt="Fig. 30.&mdash;Mu-av Ca&ntilde;on, a side gorge" title="Fig. 30.&mdash;Mu-av Ca&ntilde;on, a side gorge" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 30.&mdash;Mu-av Ca&ntilde;on, a side gorge</span>
</div>

<p>Late in the afternoon I return, and go up a
little gulch, just above this creek, and about two
hundred yards from camp, and discover the ruins
of two or three old houses, which were originally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of stone, laid in mortar. Only the foundations
are left, but irregular blocks, of which the houses
were constructed, lie scattered about. In one
room I find an old mealing stone, deeply worn, as
if it had been much used. A great deal of pottery
is strewn around, and old trails, which in some
places are deeply worn into the rocks, are seen.</p>

<p>It is ever a source of wonder to us why these
ancient people sought such inaccessible places for
their homes. They were, doubtless, an agricultural
race, but there are no lands here of any considerable
extent that they could have cultivated.
To the west of Oraiby, one of the towns in the
&ldquo;Province of Tusayan,&rdquo; in Northern Arizona, the
inhabitants have actually built little terraces
along the face of the cliff, where a spring gushes
out, and thus made their sites for gardens. It
is possible that the ancient inhabitants of this
place made their agricultural lands in the same
way. But why should they seek such spots?
Surely, the country was not so crowded with population
as to demand the utilization of so barren
a region. The only solution of the problem suggested
is this: We know that, for a century or
two after the settlement of Mexico, many expeditions
were sent into the country, now comprised
in Arizona and New Mexico, for the purpose of
bringing the town-building people under the
dominion of the Spanish Government. Many
of their villages were destroyed, and the inhabitants
fled to regions at that time unknown; and
there are traditions among the people who inhabit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the <i>pueblos</i> that still remain that the ca&ntilde;ons
were these unknown lands. Maybe these buildings
were erected at that time; sure it is that they
have a much more modern appearance than the
ruins scattered over Nevada, Utah, Colorado,
Arizona, and New Mexico. Those old Spanish
conquerors had a monstrous greed for gold, and
a wonderful lust for saving souls. Treasures
they must have if not on earth, why, then, in
heaven; and when they failed to find heathen
temples bedecked with silver, they propitiated
Heaven by seizing the heathen themselves.
There is yet extant a copy of a record, made by
a heathen artist, to express his conception of the
demands of the conquerors. In one part of the
picture we have a lake, and near by stands a
priest pouring water on the head of a native. On
the other side, a poor Indian has a cord about his
throat. Lines run from these two groups to a
central figure, a man with beard and full Spanish
panoply. The interpretation of the picture-writing
is this: &ldquo;Be baptized, as this saved
heathen; or be hanged, as that damned heathen.&rdquo;
Doubtless, some of these people preferred a third
alternative, and, rather than be baptized or
hanged, they chose to be imprisoned within these
ca&ntilde;on walls.</p>

<p><i>August 17.</i> Our rations are still spoiling; the
bacon is so badly injured that we are compelled
to throw it away. By accident, this morning,
the saleratus is lost overboard. We have now
only musty flour sufficient for ten days, a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
dried apples, but plenty of coffee. We must
make all haste possible. If we meet with difficulties,
as we have done in the ca&ntilde;on above,
we may be compelled to give up the expedition,
and try to reach the Mormon settlements to the
north. Our hopes are that the worst places are
passed, but our barometers are all so much injured
as to be useless, so we have lost our reckoning in
altitude, and know not how much descent the
river has yet to make.</p>

<p>The stream is still wild and rapid, and rolls
through a narrow channel. We make but slow
progress, often landing against a wall, and climbing
around some point, where we can see the
river below. Although very anxious to advance,
we are determined to run with great caution, lest,
by another accident, we lose all our supplies.
How precious that little flour has become! We
divide it among the boats, and carefully store it
away, so that it can be lost only by the loss of
the boat itself.</p>

<p>We make ten miles and a half, and camp among
the rocks on the right. We have had rain, from
time to time, all day, and have been thoroughly
drenched and chilled; but between showers the
sun shines with great power, and the mercury in
our thermometers stands at 115&deg;, so that we have
rapid changes from great extremes, which are
very disagreeable. It is especially cold in the
rain to-night. The little canvas we have is rotten
and useless; the rubber ponchos, with which we
started from Green River City, have all been lost;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
more than half the party is without hats, and not
one of us has an entire suit of clothes, and we have
not a blanket apiece. So we gather driftwood,
and build a fire; but after supper the rain, coming
down in torrents, extinguishes it, and we sit up
all night on the rocks, shivering, and are more exhausted
by the night's discomfort than by the
day's toil.</p>

<p><i>August 18.</i> The day is employed in making
portages, and we advance but two miles on our
journey. Still it rains.</p>

<p>While the men are at work making portages, I
climb up the granite to its summit, and go away
back over the rust-coloured sandstones and
greenish-yellow shales to the foot of the marble
wall. I climb so high that the men and boats
are lost in the black depths below, and the dashing
river is a rippling brook; and still there is
more ca&ntilde;on above than below. All about me are
interesting geological records. The book is open,
and I can read as I run. All about me are grand
views, for the clouds are playing again in the
gorges. But somehow I think of the nine days'
rations, and the bad river, and the lesson of the
rocks, and the glory of the scene is but half seen.</p>

<p>I push on to an angle, where I hope to get a
view of the country beyond, to see, if possible,
what the prospect may be of our soon running
through this plateau, or, at least, of meeting
with some geological change that will let us out
of the granite; but, arriving at the point, I can
see below only a labyrinth of deep gorges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 19.</i> Rain again this morning. Still
we are in our granite prison, and the time is occupied
until noon in making a long, bad portage.</p>

<p>After dinner, in running a rapid, the pioneer
boat is upset by a wave. We are some distance
in advance of the larger boats, the river is rough
and swift, and we are unable to land, but cling to
the boat, and are carried down stream over another
rapid. The men in the boats above see our
trouble, but they are caught in whirlpools, and
are spinning about in eddies, and it seems a long
time before they come to our relief. At last they
do come; our boat is turned right side up, bailed
out; the oars, which fortunately have floated
along in company with us, are gathered up, and
on we go, without even landing.</p>

<p>Soon after the accident the clouds break away,
and we have sunshine again.</p>

<p>Soon we find a little beach, with just room
enough to land. Here we camp, but there is no
wood. Across the river, and a little way above,
we see some driftwood lodged in the rocks. So
we bring two boatloads over, build a huge fire,
and spread everything to dry. It is the first
cheerful night we have had for a week; a warm,
drying fire in the midst of the camp and a few
bright stars in our patch of heavens overhead.</p>

<p><i>August 20.</i> The characteristics of the ca&ntilde;on
change this morning. The river is broader, the
walls more sloping, and composed of black slates,
that stand on edge. These nearly vertical slates
are washed out in places&mdash;that is, the softer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
beds are washed out between the harder, which
are left standing. In this way curious little
alcoves are formed, in which are quiet bays of
water, but on a much smaller scale than the great
bays and buttresses of Marble Ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>The river is still rapid, and we stop to let down
with lines several times, but make greater progress
as we run ten miles. We camp on the right bank.
Here, on a terrace of trap, we discover another
group of ruins. There was evidently quite a
village on this rock. Again we find mealing
stones, and much broken pottery, and up in a
little natural shelf in the rock, back of the ruins,
we find a globular basket, that would hold perhaps
a third of a bushel. It is badly broken, and,
as I attempt to take it up, it falls to pieces.
There are many beautiful flint-chips, as if this had
been the home of an old arrow-maker.</p>

<p><i>August 21.</i> We start early this morning,
cheered by the prospect of a fine day, and encouraged,
also, by the good run made yesterday.
A quarter of a mile below camp the river
turns abruptly to the left, and between camp and
that point is very swift, running down in a long,
broken chute, and piling up against the foot of
the cliff, where it turns to the left. We try to
pull across, so as to go down on the other side, but
the waters are swift, and it seems impossible for
us to escape the rock below; but, in pulling across,
the bow of the boat is turned to the farther shore,
so that we are swept broadside down, and are prevented,
by the rebounding waters, from striking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
against the wall. There we toss about for a few
seconds in these billows, and are carried past the
danger. Below, the river turns again to the
right, the ca&ntilde;on is very narrow, and we see in
advance but a short distance. The water, too,
is very swift, and there is no landing-place.
From around this curve there comes a mad roar,
and down we are earned, with a dizzying velocity,
to the head of another rapid. On either side,
high over our heads, there are overhanging granite
walls, and the sharp bends cut off our view, so
that a few minutes will carry us into unknown
waters. Away we go, on one long winding chute.
I stand on deck, supporting myself with a strap,
fastened on either side to the gunwale, and the
boat glides rapidly, where the water is smooth, or,
striking a wave, she leaps and bounds like a thing
of life, and we have a wild, exhilarating ride for
ten miles, which we make in less than an hour.
The excitement is so great that we forget the
danger, until we hear the roar of a great fall below;
then we back on our oars, and are carried
slowly towards its head, and succeed in landing
just above, and find that we have to make another
portage. At this we are engaged until
some time after dinner.</p>

<p>Just here we run out of the granite!</p>

<p>Ten miles in less than half a day, and limestone
walls below. Good cheer returns; we forget the
storms, and the gloom, and cloud-covered ca&ntilde;ons,
and the black granite, and the raging river, and
push our boats from shore in great glee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>Though we are out of the granite, the river is
still swift, and we wheel about a point again to
the right, and turn, so as to head back in the
direction from which we come, and see the granite
again, with its narrow gorge and black crags; but
we meet with no more great falls or rapids. Still,
we run cautiously, and stop, from time to time,
to examine some places which look bad. Yet,
we make ten miles this afternoon; twenty miles,
in all, to-day.</p>

<p><i>August 22.</i> We come to rapids again, this
morning, and are occupied several hours in passing
them, letting the boats down, from rock to
rock, with lines, for nearly half a mile, and then
have to make a long portage. While the men are
engaged in this, I climb the wall on the northeast,
to a height of about 2,500 feet, where I can obtain
a good view of a long stretch of ca&ntilde;on below.
Its course is to the southwest. The walls seem
to rise very abruptly, for 2,500 or 3,000 feet, and
then there is a gently sloping terrace, on each
side, for two or three miles, and again we find
cliffs, 1,500 or 2,000 feet high. From the brink
of these the plateau stretches back to the north
and south, for a long distance. Away down the
ca&ntilde;on, on the right wall, I can see a group of
mountains, some of which appear to stand on the
brink of the ca&ntilde;on. The effect of the terrace is
to give the appearance of a narrow, winding valley,
with high walls on either side, and a deep,
dark, meandering gorge down its middle. It is
impossible, from this point of view, to determine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
whether we have granite at the bottom or not;
but, from geological considerations, I conclude
that we shall have marble walls below.</p>

<p>After my return to the boats, we run another
mile and camp for the night.</p>

<p>We have made but little over seven miles to-day,
and a part of our flour has been soaked in the
river again.</p>

<p><i>August 23.</i> Our way to-day is again through
marble walls. Now and then we pass, for a
short distance, through patches of granite, like
hills thrust up into the limestone. At one of
these places we have to make another portage,
and, taking advantage of the delay, I go up a
little stream to the north, wading it all the way,
sometimes having to take a plunge in to my neck;
in other places being compelled to swim across
little basins that have been excavated at the foot
of the falls. Along its course are many cascades
and springs, gushing out from the rocks on either
side. Sometimes a cottonwood tree grows over
the water. I come to one beautiful fall, of more
than a hundred and fifty feet, and climb around it
to the right, on the broken rocks. Still going up,
I find the ca&ntilde;on narrowing very much, being but
fifteen or twenty feet wide; yet the walls rise on
either side many hundreds of feet, perhaps thousands;
I can hardly tell.</p>

<p>In some places the stream has not excavated its
channel down vertically through the rocks, but
has cut obliquely, so that one wall overhangs
the other. In other places it is cut vertically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
above and obliquely below, or obliquely above
and vertically below, so that it is impossible to see
out overhead. But I can go no farther. The
time which I estimated it would take to make the
portage has almost expired, and I start back on a
round trot, wading in the creek where I must, and
plunging through basins, and find the men waiting
for me, and away we go on the river.</p>

<p>Just after dinner we pass a stream on the right,
which leaps into the Colorado by a direct fall of
more than a hundred feet, forming a beautiful
cascade. There is a bed of very hard rock above,
thirty or forty feet in thickness, and much softer
beds below. The hard beds above project many
yards beyond the softer, which are washed out,
forming a deep cave behind the fall, and the
stream pours through a crevice above into a deep
pool below. Around on the rocks, in the cave-like
chamber, are set beautiful ferns, with delicate
fronds and enamelled stalks. The little frondlets
have their points turned down, to form spore
cases. It has very much the appearance of the
maiden's hair fern, but is much larger. This
delicate foliage covers the rocks all about the
fountain, and gives the chamber great beauty.
But we have little time to spend in admiration, so
on we go.</p>

<p>We make fine progress this afternoon, carried
along by a swift river, and shoot over the rapids,
finding no serious obstructions.</p>

<p>The ca&ntilde;on walls, for 2,500 or 3,000 feet, are
very regular, rising almost perpendicularly, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
here and there set with narrow steps, and occasionally
we can see away above the broad terrace,
to distant cliffs.</p>

<p>We camp to-night in a marble cave, and find,
on looking at our reckoning, we have run twenty-two
miles.</p>

<p><i>August 24.</i> The ca&ntilde;on is wider to-day. The
walls rise to a vertical height of nearly 3,000 feet.
In many places the river runs under a cliff, in
great curves, forming amphitheatres, half-dome
shaped.</p>

<p>Though the river is rapid, we meet with no
serious obstructions, and run twenty miles. It
is curious how anxious we are to make-up our
reckoning every time we stop, now that our diet
is confined to plenty of coffee, very little spoiled
flour, and very few dried apples. It has come to
be a race for a dinner. Still, we make such fine
progress, all hands are in good cheer, but not a
moment of daylight is lost.</p>

<p><i>August 25.</i> We make twelve miles this morning,
when we come to monuments of lava, standing
in the river; low rocks mostly, but some of
them shafts more than a hundred feet high. Going
on down, three or four miles, we find them
increasing in number. Great quantities of
cooled lava and many cinder cones are seen on
either side; and then we come to an abrupt cataract.
Just over the fall, on the right wall, a cinder
cone, or extinct volcano, with a well-defined
crater, stands on the very brink of the ca&ntilde;on.
This, doubtless, is the one we saw two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
days ago. From this volcano vast floods of lava
have been poured into the river, and a stream of
the molten rock has run up the ca&ntilde;on, three or
four miles, and down, we know not how far.
Just where it poured over the ca&ntilde;on wall is the
fall. The whole north side, as far as we can see,
is lined with the black basalt, and high up on the
opposite wall are patches of the same material,
resting on the benches, and filling old alcoves and
caves, giving to the wall a spotted appearance.</p>

<p>The rocks are broken in two, along a line which
here crosses the river, and the beds, which we
have seen coming down the ca&ntilde;on for the last
thirty miles, have dropped eight hundred feet,
on the lower side of the line, forming what geologists
call a fault. The volcanic cone stands
directly over the fissure thus formed. On the
side of the river opposite, mammoth springs
burst out of this crevice, one or two hundred
feet above the river, pouring in a stream
quite equal in volume to the Colorado Chiquito.</p>

<p>This stream seems to be loaded with carbonate
of lime, and the water, evaporating, leaves an incrustation
on the rocks; and this process has been
continued for a long time, for extensive deposits
are noticed, in which are basins, with bubbling
springs. The water is salty.</p>

<p>We have to make a portage here, which is completed
in about three hours, and on we go.</p>

<p>We have no difficulty as we float along, and I
am able to observe the wonderful phenomena connected
with this flood of lava. The ca&ntilde;on was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
doubtless filled to a height of twelve or fifteen
hundred feet, perhaps by more than one flood.
This would dam the water back; and in cutting
through this great lava bed, a new channel has
been formed, sometimes on one side, sometimes
on the other. The cooled lava, being of firmer
texture than the rocks of which the walls are
composed, remains in some places; in others a
narrow channel has been cut, leaving a line of
basalt on either side. It is possible that the lava
cooled faster on the sides against the walls, and
that the centre ran out; but of this we can only
conjecture. There are other places, where almost
the whole of the lava is gone, patches of it
only being seen where it has caught on the walls.
As we float down, we can see that it ran out into
side ca&ntilde;ons. In some places this basalt has a
fine, columnar structure, often in concentric
prisms, and masses of these concentric columns
have coalesced. In some places, where the flow
occurred, the ca&ntilde;on was probably at about the
same depth as it is now, for we can see where the
basalt has rolled out on the sands, and, what
seems curious to me, the sands are not melted or
metamorphosed to any appreciable extent. In
places the bed of the river is of sandstone or limestone,
in other places of lava, showing that it has
all been cut out again where the sandstones and
limestones appear; but there is a little yet left
where the bed is of lava.</p>

<p>What a conflict of water and fire there must
have been here! Just imagine a river of molten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
rock, running down into a river of melted snow.
What a seething and boiling of the waters; what
clouds of steam rolled into the heavens!</p>

<p>Thirty-five miles to-day. Hurrah!</p>

<p><i>August 26.</i> The ca&ntilde;on walls are steadily becoming
higher as we advance. They are still
bold, and nearly vertical up to the terrace. We
still see evidence of the eruption discovered yesterday,
but the thickness of the basalt is decreasing,
as we go down the stream; yet it has been
reinforced at points by streams that have come
from volcanoes standing on the terrace above,
but which we cannot see from the river below.</p>

<p>Since we left the Colorado Chiquito, we have
seen no evidences that the tribe of Indians inhabiting
the plateaus on either side ever come down
to the river; but about eleven o'clock to-day we
discover an Indian garden, at the foot of the
wall on the right, just where a little stream, with
a narrow flood plain, comes down through a side
ca&ntilde;on. Along the valley, the Indians have
planted corn, using the water which burst out in
springs at the foot of the cliff for irrigation. The
corn is looking quite well, but is not sufficiently
advanced to give us roasting ears; but there are
some nice green squashes. We carry ten or a
dozen of these on board our boats, and hurriedly
leave, not willing to be caught in the robbery, yet
excusing ourselves by pleading our great want.
We run down a short distance to where we feel
certain no Indians can follow; and what a kettle
of squash sauce we make! True, we have no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
salt with which to season it, but it makes a fine
addition to our unleavened bread and coffee.
Never was fruit so sweet as those stolen squashes.
After dinner we push on again, making fine time,
finding many rapids, but none so bad that we cannot
run them with safety, and when we stop, just
at dusk, and foot up our reckoning, we find that;
we have run thirty-five miles again.</p>

<p>What a supper we make; unleavened bread,
green squash sauce, and strong coffee. We have
been for a few days on half-rations, but we have
no stint of roast squash.</p>

<p>A few days like this, and we are out of prison.</p>

<p><i>August 27.</i> This morning the river takes a
more southerly direction. The dip of the rocks
is to the north, and we are rapidly running into
lower formations. Unless our course changes, we
shall very soon run again into the granite. This
gives us some anxiety. Now and then the river
turns to the west, and excites hopes that are soon
destroyed by another turn to the south. About
nine o'clock we come to the dreaded rock. It is
with no little misgiving that we see the river
enter those black, hard walls. At its very entrance
we have to make a portage; then we have
to let down with lines past some ugly rocks.
Then we run a mile or two farther, and then the
rapids below can be seen.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock we come to a place where
it seems much worse than any we have yet met in
all its course. A little creek comes down from
the left. We land first on the right, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
clamber up over the granite pinnacles for a mile
or two, but can see no way by which we can let
down, and to run it would be sure destruction.
After dinner we cross to examine it on the left.
High above the river we can walk along on the
top of the granite, which is broken off at the edge,
and set with crags and pinnacles, so that it is
very difficult to get a view of the river at all. In
my eagerness to reach a point where I can see the
roaring fall below, I go too far on the wall, and
can neither advance nor retreat. I stand with
one foot on a little projecting rock, and cling
with my hand fixed in a little crevice. Finding
I am caught here, suspended four hundred feet
above the river, into which I should fall if my
footing fails, I call for help. The men come, and
pass me a line, but I cannot let go of the rock long
enough to take hold of it. Then they bring two
or three of the largest oars. All this takes time
which seems very precious to me; but at last they
arrive. The blade of one of the oars is pushed
into a little crevice in the rock beyond me, in
such a manner that they can hold me pressed
against the wall. Then another is fixed in
such a way that I can step on it, and thus I am
extricated.</p>

<p>Still another hour is spent in examining the
river from this side, but no good view of it is
obtained, so now we return to the side that was
first examined, and the afternoon is spent in
clambering among the crags and pinnacles, and
carefully scanning the river again. We find that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the lateral streams have washed boulders into the
river, so as to form a dam over which the water
makes a broken fall of eighteen or twenty feet;
then there is a rapid, beset with rocks, for two or
three hundred yards, while, on the other side,
points of the wall project into the river. Then
there is a second fall below; how great, we cannot
tell. Then there is a rapid, filled with huge rocks,
for one or two hundred yards. At the bottom of
it, from the right wall, a great rock projects quite
half-way across the river. It has a sloping surface
extending upstream, and the water, coming
down with all the momentum gained in the falls
and rapids above, rolls up this inclined plane
many feet and tumbles over to the left. I decide
that it is possible to let down over the first fall,
then run near the right cliff to a point just above
the second, where we can pull out into a little
chute, and, having run over that in safety, we
must pull with all our power across the stream,
to avoid the great rock below. On my return to
the boat, I announce to the men that we are to
run it in the morning. Then we cross the river,
and go down into camp for the night on some
rocks, in the mouth of the little side ca&ntilde;on.</p>

<p>After supper Captain Howland asks to have a
talk with me. We walk up the little creek a
short distance, and I soon find that his object is
to remonstrate against my determination to proceed.
He thinks that we had better abandon the
river here. Talking with him, I learn that his
brother, William Dunn, and himself have determined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to go no farther in the boats. So we
return to camp. Nothing is said to the other
men.</p>

<p>For the last two days our course has not been
plotted. I sit down and do this now, for the
purpose of finding where we are by dead reckoning.
It is a clear night, and I take out the sextant
to make observations for latitude, and find
that the astronomic determination agrees very
nearly with that of the plot&mdash;quite as closely as
might be expected, from a meridian observation
on a planet. In a direct line, we must be about
forty-five miles from the mouth of the Rio Virgen.
If we can reach that point, we know that there
are settlements up that river about twenty miles.
This forty-five miles, in a direct line, will probably
be eighty or ninety in the meandering line
of the river. But then we know that there is
comparatively open country for many miles
about the mouth of the Virgen, which is our
point of destination.</p>

<p>As soon as I determine all this, I spread my
plot on the sand, and wake Howland, who is
sleeping down by the river, and show him where
I suppose we are, and where several Mormon
settlements are situated.</p>

<p>We have another short talk about the morrow,
and he lies down again; but for me there is no
sleep. All night long I pace up and down a little
path, on a few yards of sand beach, along by the
river. Is it wise to go on? I go to the boats
again, to look at our rations. I feel satisfied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
that we can get over the danger immediately
before us; what there may be below I know not.
From our outlook yesterday, on the cliffs, the
ca&ntilde;on seemed to make another great bend to the
south, and this, from our experience heretofore,
means more and higher granite walls. I am not
sure that we can climb out of the ca&ntilde;on here, and,
when at the top of the wall, I know enough of the
country to be certain that it is a desert of rock
and sand, between this and the nearest Mormon
town, which, on the most direct line, must be
seventy-five miles away. True, the late rains
have been favourable to us, should we go out,
for the probabilities are that we shall find water
still standing in holes, and, at one time, I almost
conclude to leave the river. But for years I have
been contemplating this trip. To leave the exploration
unfinished, to say that there is a part of
the ca&ntilde;on which I cannot explore, having already
almost accomplished it, is more than I am willing
to acknowledge, and I determine to go on.</p>

<p>I wake my brother and tell him of Howland's
determination, and he promises to stay with me;
then I call up Hawkins, the cook, and he makes a
like promise; then Sumner, and Bradley, and
Hall, and they all agree to go on.</p>

<p><i>August 28.</i> At last daybreak comes, and we
have breakfast, without a word being said about
the future. The meal is as solemn as a funeral.
After breakfast I ask the three men if they still
think it best to leave us. The elder Howland
thinks it is, and Dunn agrees with him. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
younger Howland tries to persuade them to go
on with the party, failing in which, he decides to
go with his brother.</p>

<p>Then we cross the river. The small boat is
very much disabled, and unseaworthy. With
the loss of hands, consequent on the departure
of the three men, we shall not be able to
run all of the boats, so I decide to leave my
<i>Emma Dean</i>.</p>

<p>Two rifles and a shotgun are given to the men
who are going out. I ask them to help themselves
to the rations, and take what they think
to be a fair share. This they refuse to do, saying
they have no fear but what they can get something
to eat; but Billy, the cook, has a pan of biscuits
prepared for dinner, and these he leaves on
a rock.</p>

<p>Before starting, we take our barometers, fossils,
the minerals, and some ammunition from the
boat and leave them on the rocks. We are going
over this place as light as possible. The three
men help us lift our boats over a rock twenty-five
or thirty feet high, and let them down
again over the first fall, and now we are all
ready to start.</p>

<p>The last thing before leaving, I write a
letter to my wife, and give it to Howland. Sumner
gives him his watch, directing that it be
sent to his sister, should he not be heard from
again. The records of the expedition have been
kept in duplicate. One set of these is given to
Howland, and now we are ready. For the last,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
time, they entreat us not to go on, and tell us that
it is madness to set out in this place; that we can
never get safely through it; and, further, that the
river turns again to the south into the granite,
and a few miles of such rapids and falls will
exhaust our entire stock of rations, and then it
will be too late to climb out. Some tears are
shed; it is a rather solemn parting; each party
thinks the other is taking the dangerous course.</p>

<p>My old boat left, I go on board of the <i>Maid of
the Ca&ntilde;on</i>. The three men climb a crag, that
overhangs the river, to watch us off. The <i>Maid
of the Ca&ntilde;on</i> pushes out. We glide rapidly along
the foot of the wall, just grazing one great rock,
then pull out a little into the chute of the second
fall, and plunge over it. The open compartment is
filled when we strike the first wave below, but we
cut through it, and then the men pull with all
their power toward the left wall, and swing clear
of the dangerous rock below all right. We are
scarcely a minute in running it, and find that,
although it looked bad from above, we have
passed many places that were worse.</p>

<p>The other boat follows with more difficulty.
We land at the first practicable point below and
fire our guns as a signal to the men above that we
have come over in safety. Here we remain a
couple of hours, hoping that they will take the
smaller boat and follow us. We are behind a
curve in the ca&ntilde;on, and cannot see up to where
we left them, and so we wait until their coming
seems hopeless, and push on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>And now we have a succession of rapids and
falls until noon, all of which we run in safety.
Just after dinner we come to another bad place.
A little stream comes in from the left, and below
there is a fall, and still below another fall. Above,
the river tumbles down, over and among the
rocks, in whirlpools and great waves, and the
waters are lashed into mad, white foam. We run
along the left, above this, and soon see that we
cannot get down on this side, but it seems possible
to let down on the other. We pull up stream
again for two or three hundred yards and cross.
Now there is a bed of basalt on this northern side
of the ca&ntilde;on with a bold escarpment, that seems
to be a hundred feet high. We can climb it, and
walk along its summit to a point where we are
just at the head of the fall. Here the basalt is
broken down again, so it seems to us, and I
direct the men to take a line to the top of the
cliff, and let the boats down along the wall. One
man remains in the boat, to keep her clear of the
rocks, and prevent her line from being caught on
the projecting angles. I climb the cliff, and pass
along to a point just over the fall, and descend by
broken rocks, and find that the break of the fall
is above the break of the wall, so that we cannot
land; and that still below the river is very bad,
find that there is no possibility of a portage.
Without waiting further to examine and determine
what shall be done, I hasten back to the
top of the cliff, to stop the boats from coming
down. When I arrive I find the men have let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
one of them down to the head of the fall. She is in
swift water, and they are not able to pull her
back; nor are they able to go on with the line, as
it is not long enough to reach the higher part of
the cliff, which is just before them; so they take
a bight around a crag. I send two men back for
the other line. The boat is in very swift water,
and Bradley is standing in the open compartment,
holding out his oar to prevent her from
striking against the foot of the cliff. Now she
shoots out into the stream, and up as far as the
line will permit, and then, wheeling, drives headlong
against the rock, then out and back again,
now straining on the line, now striking against
the rock. As soon as the second line is brought,
we pass it down to him; but his attention is all
taken up with his own situation, and he does not
see that we are passing the line to him. I stand
on a projecting rock, waving my hat to gain his
attention, for my voice is drowned by the roaring
of the falls. Just at this moment, I see him take
his knife from its sheath, and step forward to
cut the line. He has evidently decided that it is
better to go over with the boat as it is, than to
wait for her to be broken to pieces. As he leans
over, the boat sheers again into the stream, the
stem-post breaks away, and she is loose. With
perfect composure Bradley seizes the great scull
oar, places it in the stern rowlock, and pulls with
all his power (and he is an athlete) to turn the
bow of the boat downstream, for he wishes to go
bow down, rather than to drift broadside on.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
One, two strokes he makes, and a third just as
she goes over, and the boat is fairly turned, and
she goes down almost beyond our sight, though
we are more than a hundred feet above the river.
Then she comes up again, on a great wave, and
down and up, then around behind some great
rocks, and is lost in the mad, white foam
below. We stand frozen with fear, for we
see no boat. Bradley is gone, so it seems.
But now, away below, we see something coming
out of the waves. It is evidently a
boat. A moment more, and we see Bradley
standing on deck, swinging his hat to
show that he is all right. But he is in a whirlpool.
We have the stem post of his boat attached
to the line. How badly she may be disabled
we know not. I direct Sumner and Powell
to pass along the cliff, and see if they can reach
him from below. Rhodes, Hall, and myself run
to the other boat, jump aboard, push out, and
away we go over the falls. A wave rolls over us,
and our boat is unmanageable. Another great
wave strikes us, the boat rolls over, and
tumbles and tosses, I know not how. All I
know is that Bradley is picking us up. We soon
have all right again, and row to the cliff, and
wait until Sumner and Powell can come. After
a difficult climb they reach us. We run two or
three miles farther, and turn again to the northwest,
continuing until night, when we have run
out of the granite once more.</p>

<p><i>August 29.</i> We start very early this morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
The river still continues swift, but we have no
serious difficulty, and at twelve o'clock emerge
from the Grand Ca&ntilde;on of the Colorado.</p>

<p>We are in a valley now, and low mountains are
seen in the distance, coming to the river below.
We recognize this as the Grand Wash.</p>

<p>A few years ago a party of Mormons set out
from St. George, Utah, taking with them a boat,
and came down to the mouth of the Grand Wash,
where they divided, a portion of the party crossing
the river to explore the San Francisco Mountains.
Three men&mdash;Hamblin, Miller, and Crosby&mdash;taking
the boat, went on down the river to
Callville, landing a few miles below the mouth of
the Rio Virgen. We have their manuscript
journal with us, and so the stream is comparatively
well known.</p>

<p>To-night we camp on the left bank in a mesquit
thicket.</p>

<p>The relief from danger and the joy of success
are great. When he who has been chained by
wounds to a hospital cot, until his canvas tent
seems like a dungeon cell, until the groans of
those who lie about, tortured with probe and
knife, are piled up, a weight of horror on his ears
that he cannot throw off, cannot forget, and until
the stench of festering wounds and an&aelig;sthetic
drugs has filled the air with its loathsome burthen,
at last goes into the open field, what a
world he sees! How beautiful the sky; how
bright the sunshine; what &ldquo;floods of delirious
music&rdquo; pour from the throats of birds; how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
sweet the fragrance of earth and tree, and blossom!
The first hour of convalescent freedom
seems rich recompense for all&mdash;pain, gloom,
terror.</p>

<p>Something like this are the feelings we experience
to-night. Ever before us has been an
unknown danger, heavier than immediate peril.
Every waking hour passed in the Grand Ca&ntilde;on
has been one of toil. We have watched with
deep solicitude the steady disappearance of our
scant supply of rations, and from time to time
have seen the river snatch a portion of the little
left, while we were ahungered. And danger and
toil were endured in those gloomy depths, where
ofttimes the clouds hid the sky by day, and but a
narrow zone of stars could be seen at night. Only
during the few hours of deep sleep, consequent
on hard labour, has the roar of the waters been
hushed. Now the danger is over; now the toil
has ceased; now the gloom has disappeared; now
the firmament is bounded only by the horizon;
and what a vast expanse of constellations can be
seen!</p>

<p>The river rolls by us in silent majesty; the
quiet of the camp is sweet; our joy is almost
ecstasy. We sit till long after midnight, talking
of the Grand Ca&ntilde;on, talking of home, but chiefly
talking of the three men who left us. Are they
wandering in those depths, unable to find a way
out? are they searching over the desert lands
above for water? or are they nearing the settlements?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><i>August 30.</i> We run two or three short, low
ca&ntilde;ons to-day, and on emerging from one, we discover
a band of Indians in the valley below.
They see us, and scamper away in most eager
haste, to hide among the rocks. Although we
land, and call for them to return, not an Indian
can be seen.</p>

<p>Two or three miles farther down, in turning a
short bend in the river, we come upon another
camp. So near are we before they can see us that
I can shout to them, and, being able to speak a
little of their language, I tell them we are friends;
but they flee to the rocks, except a man, a woman,
and two children. We land, and talk with them.
They are without lodges, but have built little
shelters of boughs, under which they wallow in
the sand. The man is dressed in a hat; the
woman in a string of beads only. At first they
are evidently much terrified; but when I talk to
them in their own language, and tell them we are
friends, and inquire after people in the Mormon
towns, they are soon reassured, and beg for tobacco.
Of this precious article we have none to spare.
Sumner looks around in the boat for something
to give them, and finds a little piece of coloured
soap, which they receive as a valuable present,
rather as a thing of beauty than as a useful commodity,
however. They are either unwilling or
unable to tell us anything about the Indians or
white people, and so we push off, for we must
lose no time.</p>

<p>We camp at noon under the right bank. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
now, as we push out, we are in great expectancy,
for we hope every minute to discover the mouth
of the Rio Virgen.</p>

<p>Soon one of the men exclaims: &ldquo;Yonder's an
Indian in the river.&rdquo; Looking for a few minutes,
we certainly do see two or three persons. The
men bend to their oars, and pull toward them.
Approaching, we see that there are three white
men and an Indian hauling a seine, and then we
discover that it is just at the mouth of the long-sought
river.</p>

<p>As we come near, the men seem far less surprised
to see us than we do to see them. They
evidently know who we are, and, on talking with
them, they tell us that we have been reported
lost long ago, and that some weeks before, a messenger
had been sent from Salt Lake City, with
instructions for them to watch for any fragments
or relics of our party that might drift down the
stream.</p>

<p>Our new-found friends, Mr. Asa and his two
sons, tell us that they are pioneers of a town that
is to be built on the bank.</p>

<p>Eighteen or twenty miles up the valley of the
Rio Virgen there are two Mormon towns, St.
Joseph and St. Thomas. To-night we despatch
an Indian to the last mentioned place, to bring
any letters that may be there for us.</p>

<p>Our arrival here is very opportune. When we
look over our store of supplies, we find about
ten pounds of flour, fifteen pounds of dried apples,
but seventy or eighty pounds of coffee.</p>
